# Error reference

Every user-facing Prisma 8 error is a structured envelope identified by a dotted `NAMESPACE.SUBCODE` code (see [ADR 239](../architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20239%20-%20Errors%20are%20structural%20envelopes%20with%20dotted%20namespace%20codes.md) and [Error Handling](../Error%20Handling.md)). This page lists every published code. It is the canonical source for the hosted reference at `https://docs.prisma.io/docs/orm/v8/reference/error-reference` (each code anchors as `#<CODE>`), and CI verifies completeness on every PR: `pnpm check:error-reference` fails if any code in production source is missing from this page.

Recognize an error programmatically with `isStructuredError` from `@internal/utils/structured-error` and match on `error.code`, never `instanceof`. Envelopes carry `message`, and optionally `why`, `fix`, `where`, `cause`, `docsUrl`, and the structured context each entry below lists as its **Payload**. The payload arrives on `error.meta` when the envelope was built by `structuredError` and on `error.details` when it was built by `runtimeError`; a few codes are raised both ways, so read whichever property the envelope carries.

Exit codes (CLI): an expected structured failure exits `2`, a user abort exits `3`, and `1` is reserved for internal errors (bugs). Codes on this page exit `2` unless the entry says otherwise.

Some codes are not failures to run at all. `db verify`, `db sign` and `migration check` answer a question about the project, and a bad answer is still an answer: they finish, report their findings as diagnostics on a successful envelope, and exit `4`. Exit `2` is reserved for the cases where those commands could not do the job: an unknown `--space`, a migration reference that resolves to nothing, an unreachable database, a contract that has not been emitted. Every entry whose code can arrive on one of those runs says so and names the command. Each of those commands declares the numbers it can exit with, and its `--help` text spells out what each one means.

A command may also **complete with findings**: it ran to its end and has a result to report, and the problems it found ride that result as diagnostics carrying the codes on this page. Those runs exit with a documented per-command code in the `4`–`99` band rather than `2`, and the entry below says so. `prisma orm init` is the case today: its scaffold is on disk whatever happens next, so a failed dependency install or contract emit is a finding on a completed run at exit `4` or `5`.

Codes that predate the dotted scheme were renamed at 0.16; the full old→new crosswalk (`PN-DOMAIN-NNNN` → `NAMESPACE.SUBCODE`) is in [ADR 239](../architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20239%20-%20Errors%20are%20structural%20envelopes%20with%20dotted%20namespace%20codes.md).

## CONFIG

### CONFIG.CONTRACT_MISSING

The `contract` section is missing (or incomplete) in `prisma.config.ts` when a command needs it, raised by `prisma contract emit` when the config has no contract configuration, no schema path, or the referenced authoring entrypoint cannot be resolved. Payload: none.

### CONFIG.DB_CONNECTION_REQUIRED

A DB-connected command (`db migrate`, `db init`, `db sign`, `db verify`, `db update`, `db schema`, and the migration scaffold commands) was run with no database connection available: no `--db <url>` flag and no `db.connection` in `prisma.config.ts`. The fix text names the exact retry command when known. Payload: `missingFlags` (optional).

### CONFIG.DRIVER_REQUIRED

A DB-connected command was run but `prisma.config.ts` has no control-plane `driver` entry (e.g. `driver: postgresDriver`). Raised by the migration command scaffold, `db migrate`, `db sign`, `db verify`, and `db schema`. Payload: none.

### CONFIG.EVALUATION_FAILED

The config module could not be evaluated at all: a syntax error in `prisma.config.ts`, or the module threw during import. Raised by the config loader for any command that needs config; loading fails outright (no per-section diagnostics are possible for a module that does not evaluate) and every command exits `2` with this error. The underlying evaluation error's message is carried in `why` and the original error in `cause` (in-process only). The path, when known, is carried in `where.path`. Payload: none.

### CONFIG.FAMILY_READ_MARKER_REQUIRED

Reserved: `db verify` needs the family package to export `verify.readMarker()` and it is absent. Declared in the shared error factories but not raised by any command today.

### CONFIG.FILE_NOT_FOUND

No `prisma.config.ts` (or the explicitly passed config path) could be found when loading configuration, raised by the config loader for any command that needs config. The fix is to run `prisma orm init` to create one. The path, when known, is carried in `where.path`. Payload: none.

### CONFIG.MISSING_EXTENSION_PACKS

The contract declares extension packs that the CLI config does not provide matching descriptors for; raised when resolving framework components for any command that loads the contract. The fix is to add the missing extension descriptors to `extensions` in `prisma.config.ts`. Payload: `missingExtensionPacks`, `providedComponentIds`.

### CONFIG.QUERY_RUNNER_FACTORY_REQUIRED

Reserved: `db verify` needs `db.queryRunnerFactory` in `prisma.config.ts` and it is absent. Declared in the shared error factories but not raised by any command today.

### CONFIG.VALIDATION_FAILED

`prisma.config.ts` loaded but a config section is missing or malformed, as seen by the ORM's own config loader (the language server, the vite plugin, and any tool that calls `loadConfig` outside a command run). The loader validates the `orm` section against its schema and returns one diagnostic per problem, each tagged with the top-level subsection it concerns (`meta.section`: `family`, `target`, `adapter`, `driver`, `extensions`, `db`, `contract`, `migrations`, or `formatter`); a command fails with the diagnostic (exit `2`) only when it reads that section. Under the `prisma` CLI the same problems are reported by the engine instead, as `CLI.CONFIG_FIELD_INVALID` diagnostics (one per field, `meta.section: 'orm'`, `meta.field` the dotted path, `where.path` the config file that declared the field) accompanying `CLI.CONFIG_SECTION_INVALID`. Also raised by framework-component resolution for fields like `frameworkComponents[]`, `frameworkComponents[].kind`/`familyId`/`targetId`, `contract.targetFamily`, and `contract.target`, and by contract-path resolution when `config.contract.output` is absent (those sites carry no `section`). Payload: `field` (loader diagnostics), `section` (loader diagnostics; optional elsewhere).

### CONFIG.VERSION_MARKER_MISSING

The config module evaluated, but its default export was not created by the current `defineConfig`: a plain object export, a spread copy of a `defineConfig` result, or a config produced by a different `defineConfig` (for example a classic Prisma 7 config file). Raised by the config loader before validation; loading fails outright and every command exits `2` with this error. The fix is to create the config with `defineConfig` (imported from your target package's `/config` entrypoint, for example `@prisma/orm-postgres/config`) and export its return value directly. The path, when known, is carried in `where.path`. Payload: none.

## CLI

### CLI.CONFIG_ARG_MISSING_PATH

The migration-file CLI (`prisma migration`) received `--config` without a path argument, either a bare trailing `--config`, or `--config` immediately followed by another flag (e.g. `--config --dry-run`). The CLI fails fast instead of consuming the next flag as the config path or silently falling back to default config discovery. Payload: `nextToken` (present only when another flag followed `--config`).

### CLI.CONSENT_OPERATIONS_MISSING

`db update` was told the plan is destructive but was given no operations to name, so the consent prompt would have asked you to authorise a list of nothing. The command refuses instead of prompting. This is an inconsistency between the CLI and the control API rather than something your project can be wrong about; run `prisma db update --dry-run` to see the plan, and report the run. Payload: none.

### CLI.CONSENT_TOKEN_UNRESOLVED

`db update` could not derive a name for the database it is about to change, so there is nothing for the consent prompt to ask you to type, and an empty token would let a bare Enter (or `--confirm ""`) authorise data loss. The name comes from the `database` a driver connection object carries, or from the connection URL (its first path segment, else its host), falling back to the target id. Name the database in `db.connection` or pass `--db <url>`. Payload: none.

### CLI.CONTRACT_ARG_CONFLICT

`prisma db sign` was given a contract reference twice, once as the positional argument and once as `--contract`, and there is no rule for which one wins. Pass it once. Payload: `positional`, `flag`.

### CLI.ADVANCE_REF_ARG_CONFLICT

`prisma db sign` was told both which ref to advance (`--advance-ref <name>`) and not to advance any ref (`--no-advance-ref`), and there is no rule for which one wins. Pass one of them. Payload: `advanceRef`.

### CLI.FILE_NOT_FOUND

A file the command needs does not exist at the given path. Produced by several commands: the migration command scaffold, `db migrate`, `migration plan`, `migration show`, `db sign`, `db update`, `db verify`, and `migration ref` all raise it when the emitted `contract.json` (or another required file) is missing from the expected location. Most sites carry the path in `where.path`; the `migration new` contract-file site carries it in the summary text only. Payload: none.

### CLI.FILE_WRITE_FAILED

Writing a file failed: currently raised when `contract format` cannot write the formatted PSL source back to disk (e.g. the file is not writable). The underlying failure is attached as `cause`. Payload: none.

### CLI.INIT_AUTHORING_SCHEMA_PATH_MISMATCH

During `prisma orm init`, `--authoring` and `--schema-path` disagree on file extension, for example `--authoring psl` with a schema path ending in `.ts`. Raised before any scaffold files are written, so the project tree stays untouched. Payload: `authoring`, `schemaPath`, `actualExtension`, `expectedExtension`.

### CLI.INIT_EMIT_FAILED

During `prisma orm init`, the `prisma contract emit` step failed after a successful dependency install. Scaffolded files and installed dependencies remain on disk; the user fixes the contract file and re-runs the emit command. `orm init` completes with this as a finding and exits 5. Payload: `filesWritten`, `cause`.

### CLI.INIT_FLAG_CONFLICT

`prisma orm init --from-prisma7-schema <path>` was combined with `--schema-path` or `--authoring`. The first names an existing Prisma 7 schema as the contract source; the other two describe a starter schema to write, so the pair contradicts itself. Raised before anything is read or written. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `flags` (the two kebab-case flag names).

### CLI.INIT_INSTALL_FAILED

During `prisma orm init`, dependency installation failed and the pnpm-to-npm fallback either did not apply or also failed. On a normal run the scaffold is already on disk, and the next actions carry the install command that was attempted and the emit that was waiting on it. On the Prisma 7 path the first install runs before anything is written, to check that the target package can read the schema; when that install fails, `filesWritten` is empty and the next action is to run `orm init` again once the dependencies install. `orm init` completes with this as a finding and exits 4. Payload: `filesWritten`, plus `install` (the attempted command, the manager, its exit code and the tail of its stderr).

### CLI.INIT_INVALID_FLAG_VALUE

A flag passed to `prisma orm init` has a value outside its allowed set (for example `--target` with something other than `postgres` or `mongodb`). Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `flag`, `value`, `allowed`.

### CLI.INIT_INVALID_MANIFEST

`prisma orm init` could not parse the project's `package.json` as JSON. Init reads the manifest to merge scripts and to skip `@types/node` when already declared, so a malformed file is a hard precondition failure the user can fix and re-run. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `path`, `cause`.

### CLI.INIT_INVALID_OUTPUT_DOCUMENT

`prisma orm init` completed but its own success output document failed schema validation. This indicates a bug in Prisma 8 itself, not user error. The engine-hosted `orm init` settles it as an errored envelope at exit 2 (the commander `orm init`, deleted in the S5 cutover, mapped it to exit 1), because the ORM's error boundary converts every failure into a structured settlement and the engine reserves exit 1 for a throw that reaches it uncaught. Payload: none.

### CLI.INIT_INVALID_TSCONFIG

`prisma orm init` could not parse the project's existing `tsconfig.json`, even with JSONC tolerance (comments and trailing commas). Init merges required compiler options into it, so an unreadable file blocks the run; raised before any scaffold file is written. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `path`, `cause`.

### CLI.INIT_MISSING_FLAGS

`prisma orm init` ran non-interactively (e.g. `--yes`, or stdin is not a TTY) but one or more required inputs (`--target`, `--authoring`, `--schema-path`) were not supplied as flags. Every missing flag is listed so scripts and agents can react without parsing English. When detection found a Prisma 7 project, the message also names `--from-prisma7-schema <path>` as the alternative; a Prisma 6 MongoDB project gets `CLI.INIT_PRISMA6_SCHEMA_FOUND` instead. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `missingFlags`, `prisma7SchemaPath` (`null` when nothing Prisma 7 was found).

### CLI.INIT_PRISMA6_SCHEMA_FOUND

`prisma orm init` found a Prisma 6 MongoDB schema (a `datasource` with `provider = "mongodb"`, which Prisma 7 does not have) where the Prisma 6 CLI looks for it (the path a Prisma 6 `prisma.config.*` or the `prisma.schema` field of `package.json` names, else `prisma/schema.prisma`, `schema.prisma` or the `prisma/schema` folder), or at the path `--from-prisma7-schema` names. Prisma 8 can read that schema through `prisma6Schema`, but init does not set it up: both CLIs are published as `prisma`, and the Prisma 6 CLI also reads `prisma.config.ts`. Init stops before asking, installing, or writing anything, and its next actions are the side-by-side setup: move the Prisma 6 CLI to an npm alias (`"prisma6": "npm:prisma@<version>"`) run through a `prisma6` script with its own config file, install Prisma 8, write `prisma.config.ts` with `prisma6Schema`, then run `contract emit` and `db sign`. Passing `--target` and `--authoring` skips this and sets up a starter in the same project, with a warning that it breaks the Prisma 6 CLI: the `prisma.config.ts` it writes makes every Prisma 6 command fail until Prisma 6 gets its own config file, and its install step replaces the Prisma 6 CLI with `prisma@latest`. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `schemaPath`, `prismaConfig` (the Prisma 8 config to write), `prisma6Config` (the Prisma 6 config to write; `null` when the project's own `prisma.config.*` is to be renamed instead).

### CLI.INIT_PRISMA7_CONFIG_COLLISION

On the Prisma 7 path of `prisma orm init`, `prisma.config.*` evaluated as a Prisma 7 config (no `$prismaConfig` marker) while a `prisma7.config.*` also exists. Init renames the Prisma 7 config to `prisma7.config.*` so Prisma 8 can write its own, and cannot rename onto an existing file. Nothing is written. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `prismaConfigPath`, `prisma7ConfigPath`.

### CLI.INIT_PRISMA7_CONFIG_UNREADABLE

On the Prisma 7 path of `prisma orm init`, `prisma.config.*` exists but failed to evaluate (typically a Prisma 7 config importing `prisma/config` in a checkout whose dependencies are not installed). Init cannot tell whether the file is Prisma 7's, to rename, or its own, to replace, so it refuses rather than overwrite it. The fix is to install the project's dependencies so the config evaluates, or rename it to `prisma7.config.<ext>` by hand; when a `prisma7.config.*` already exists, init leaves `prisma.config.*` alone and the fix is to install the dependencies and fix the error in it instead. The normal path is unaffected: without the flag or a yes to the Prisma 7 question, the file is treated as it is today. Nothing is written. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `path`, `why`, `prisma7ConfigPath` (`null` when none exists).

### CLI.INIT_PRISMA7_PROVIDER_UNSUPPORTED

On the Prisma 7 path of `prisma orm init`, the schema's `datasource` block declares a provider Prisma 8 has no target for, or no string provider at all. The supported list is in the payload. When the provider is not a string literal, passing `--target` names the database instead; a string provider with no target is refused whatever `--target` says. Nothing is written or installed. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `schemaPath`, `provider` (`null` when not a string literal), `supported`.

### CLI.INIT_PRISMA7_SCHEMA_INVALID

The path `prisma orm init` was asked to use as a Prisma 7 schema (`--from-prisma7-schema`, or the path the interactive question named) does not exist, or neither it nor any `.prisma` file under it has a `datasource` block. Nothing is written. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `schemaPath`, `reason` (`absent` or `no-datasource`).

### CLI.INIT_PRISMA7_SCHEMA_REFUSED

On the Prisma 7 path of `prisma orm init`, the target package's Prisma 7 contract source refused the schema, for example because it contains a `view` block or an `Unsupported(...)` field. Init runs the source after installing the target package and `dotenv` and before any consent question or file change, so the project is unchanged apart from those two packages. The `why` lists each diagnostic as `<sourceId>:<line>:<column> <code> <message>`. The next actions say to edit the schema as each finding says (the target package's README lists every refusal and its fix) or to run init without `--from-prisma7-schema`, and give the command that removes the two packages. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `schemaPath`, `summary`, `diagnostics`, `packagesAdded` (the packages the project did not declare before the check; the remove command names only these).

### CLI.INIT_PRISMA7_SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE

On the Prisma 7 path of `prisma orm init`, the target package cannot read the Prisma 7 schema. Either it has no `prisma7Schema` export while `--from-prisma7-schema` asked for one (`reason: no-prisma7-source`), or it could not be loaded from the project after init installed it (`reason: not-resolvable`). When the user entered the Prisma 7 path by answering yes to init's question instead of passing the flag, a package without `prisma7Schema` is not an error: init warns and runs as a fresh init. Nothing is written apart from the target package and `dotenv` the check installed, and the next actions give the command that removes them. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `schemaPath`, `packageName`, `reason`, `packagesAdded` (the packages the project did not declare before the check).

### CLI.INIT_PRISMA7_TARGET_MISMATCH

On the Prisma 7 path of `prisma orm init`, `--target` names a different database than the schema's `datasource` provider, for example `--target mongodb` for a schema that declares `provider = "postgresql"`. With `--from-prisma7-schema` it is refused before anything is asked, installed, or written. Without the flag init does not ask its Prisma 7 question and runs as a fresh init, so this code is not raised. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `schemaPath`, `provider`, `target` (as passed).

### CLI.INIT_PROBE_FAILED

`prisma orm init --probe-db --strict-probe` was run and the database probe could not complete (no `DATABASE_URL`, network or auth error, driver not installed). Without `--strict-probe` these surface as warnings; strict mode escalates them to fatal. Scaffolded files are already on disk when this fires. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `filesWritten`, `cause`.

### CLI.INIT_REINIT_NEEDS_FORCE

`prisma orm init` ran non-interactively in a directory that already has a `prisma.config.ts`, and consent to overwrite the existing scaffold was not given. Re-scaffolding is destructive, so it needs explicit consent: interactively, `orm init` asks the user to type the working directory's name back; non-interactively, the same consent is granted by `--confirm <directory name>`. Neither `--yes` nor any flag skips it. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: none.

The code was raised by the commander `orm init` (deleted in the S5 cutover), whose consent flag was `--force`. The engine-hosted `orm init` reaches the same outcome through the engine's own `CLI.CONSENT_REQUIRED`, which names the exact `--confirm` value to pass.

### CLI.INIT_SKILL_INSTALL_FAILED

Retired. `prisma orm init` used to fetch the agent skills from GitHub with `skills add`, and raised this at exit `6` when that fetch failed. The skills now ship inside the `@prisma/orm-*` packages a project installs, and `orm init` no longer touches them at all: skills setup belongs to the family-level `prisma init` command, and `prisma skills sync` copies the skills out of the installed packages whenever it runs. Init's remaining failure exits are `4` (dependency install failed) and `5` (contract emission failed); there is no exit `6`, and nothing raises this code.

### CLI.INIT_STRICT_PROBE_WITHOUT_PROBE

`prisma orm init --strict-probe` was supplied without `--probe-db`. Init is offline-by-default, so no probe runs without `--probe-db`; rather than silently ignoring the strict flag, init errors and tells the user to add `--probe-db` or drop `--strict-probe`. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: none.

### CLI.INIT_USER_ABORTED

The user cancelled an interactive `prisma orm init` prompt (Ctrl-C, escape, or declining a selection) before all required inputs were supplied. No files were modified. Severity is `info`, not `error`; maps to init exit code 3 (USER_ABORTED). Payload: none.

Raised by the commander `orm init` (deleted in the S5 cutover). On the engine-hosted `orm init` a cancelled prompt is the engine's own `CLI.PROMPT_CANCELLED`, which exits 3 for every command rather than only this one; the engine-hosted `orm init` keeps this code for a consent the user declines, which settles as an errored envelope at exit 2 like every other structured failure there. Because that command's consent declares a token, the engine answers a wrong or absent answer with `CLI.PROMPT_INVALID` or `CLI.CONSENT_REQUIRED` before a decline can be expressed, so the code is the refusal that runs if a future consent drops its token.

### CLI.INIT_WRITE_FAILED

`prisma orm init` could not write one of the files it scaffolds: a directory sitting where the file goes, permissions, a full disk. Everything that can be read and parsed is checked before the first write, so this is the failure that survives that check; the files written before it are already on disk and are listed so a follow-up run or agent knows the state it is resuming from. On the Prisma 7 path the config rename happens before the first write, so a completed rename is listed too (`filesRenamed`, `from` and `to`); it stays in place and a re-run writes the missing files beside it. Maps to init exit code 2 (PRECONDITION). Payload: `path`, `cause`, `filesWritten`, `filesRenamed`.

### CLI.INVALID_OUTPUT_FORMAT

The main CLI received a `--format` value other than `pretty` or `json`. Raised during global-flag resolution, before any command logic runs. Payload: `value`, `allowed`.

### CLI.INVALID_VERIFY_MODE

`prisma db verify` was given a contradictory mode combination: `--marker-only` together with `--schema-only`, or `--strict` together with `--marker-only` (strict requires schema verification, which marker-only skips). Payload: none.

### CLI.JSON_FORMAT_UNSUPPORTED

Reserved: a command was asked for a `--json` sub-format it does not support; the error lists the formats the command does accept. Declared in the shared error factories but not raised by any command today. Payload: `command`, `format`, `supportedFormats`.

### CLI.OUTPUT_FORMAT_CONFLICT

The main CLI received mutually exclusive output flags: `--format pretty` together with `--json`. Use `--format json` or `--json` alone for JSON output. Payload: none.

### CLI.PROJECT_MANIFEST_INVALID

A `package.json` found while resolving the project import root is not valid JSON, or parses to something other than a JSON object. Emission reads the nearest manifest to decide which package names generated files should import; fix the manifest's JSON and re-run. The parse failure (when there is one) is attached as `cause`. Payload: `path`.

### CLI.PROJECT_MANIFEST_UNREADABLE

A `package.json` found while resolving the project import root exists but could not be read (e.g. a permissions failure). Absent manifests continue the walk up; a read failure stops it, because silently skipping would emit against the wrong project's dependencies. The read failure is attached as `cause`. Payload: `path`.

### CLI.PROMPT_REQUIRED

Raised by `@prisma/cli-engine`, not by this repository: a command asked a question that has no default, and the session could not show it: stdin is not a terminal, `--no-interactive` was passed, or `--yes` was asked to answer a prompt that declares no default. The `CLI` namespace is shared with the engine (see [ADR 239](../architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20239%20-%20Errors%20are%20structural%20envelopes%20with%20dotted%20namespace%20codes.md)); it is listed here because it settles runs of the ORM's commands. `prisma orm init` translates it for the two prompts that stand in for a required flag, so a missing `--target` or `--authoring` still reports `CLI.INIT_MISSING_FLAGS` with the full missing list. Payload: none.

### CLI.UNEXPECTED

Catch-all for an unanticipated failure inside a CLI command: an unclassified exception is wrapped in this envelope with the original message in the `why`, without the connection string. Thrown across nearly every command (migrate, db init/sign/update/verify, migration plan/new/show/status/log, contract emit, ref, inspect-live-schema, config loading). Payload: `code`, when the exception carried one that is not a structured code, such as a driver's `ECONNREFUSED` or a SQLSTATE; otherwise none.

### CLI.UNKNOWN_FLAG

The migration-file CLI (`prisma migration`) received a flag it does not recognise; wraps clipanion's unknown-syntax error at the parser boundary so consumers can build "did you mean" suggestions from meta instead of parsing the message. Payload: `flag`, `knownFlags`.

## CONTRACT

### CONTRACT.ARGUMENT_INVALID

A builder or helper on the contract-authoring surface is called with a bad argument: a composed authoring helper receives too many arguments or a malformed trailing options object, `field.sql({ id })` / `field.sql({ unique })` is used without a matching inline `.id(...)` / `.unique(...)` declaration, `model("Name", ...)` is called without a model definition, a nanoid ID generator is given a size outside 2–255, or an authored index combines its cross-field parameters invalidly (fields and an expression together or neither, an expression without `name:`/`map:`, or `map:` combined with `name:`). Also raised when a contract targets SQLite and declares an expression or partial index: SQLite's namespace construction rejects `expression:`/`where:` because the target does not support them. Also raised when a column with a literal default has type parameters that its codec does not accept (meta: `modelName`, `fieldName`, `codecId`, `reason: 'type-params-invalid'`; the codec's error is the `cause`). Raised while authoring/building the contract, before emit. Payload: varies per site.

### CONTRACT.AGGREGATE_DESCRIPTOR_AMBIGUOUS

The SQL emitter cannot name one result type for an aggregate: two trait-matching aggregate descriptors both claim a contributed codec, or a descriptor whose result reuses its input's codec also answers calls that carry no input. Raised while generating `contract.d.ts`, so the emitted types can never disagree with what the runtime registry resolves. Payload: `operation`; plus `codecId` and `traits` when two traits claim one codec, the contested codec being nameable only in that case.

### CONTRACT.AGGREGATE_DESCRIPTOR_DUPLICATE

Two composed components contribute an aggregate descriptor for the same `(operation, input)` overload, keyed as `sum:trait:numeric`, `sum:codec:pg/int8@1`, or `count:none`. Each overload resolves to exactly one result codec, so exactly one target, adapter, or extension may claim it. Raised while the control stack collects contributions (e.g. during `contract emit`); the runtime plane enforces the same rule as `RUNTIME.DUPLICATE_AGGREGATE_DESCRIPTOR`. Payload: `key`, `contributedBy`, `owner`.

### CONTRACT.AGGREGATE_DESCRIPTOR_INVALID

A composed component contributes an aggregate descriptor whose shape the framework cannot read: a missing or empty `operation`, an `input` match that is not `none` / `any` / `codec` / `trait`, an `output` that is not `self` / `codec`, a non-boolean `nullable`, a `nullable: false` descriptor with no `emptyResultJson` (a non-nullable result must declare the value it answers with over no result row), or a `self` output on a match that may carry no input to reuse. Raised while the control stack collects contributions (e.g. during `contract emit`); the runtime plane enforces the same rule as `RUNTIME.AGGREGATE_DESCRIPTOR_INVALID`. Payload: `contributedBy`, `descriptor`.

### CONTRACT.AGGREGATE_OUTPUT_CODEC_MISSING

The SQL emitter is asked to emit an aggregate result row whose declared result codec the composed stack does not contribute: the emitted type would name a codec absent from the contract's codec map, and every consumer reading it would resolve `never`. Contribute the codec, or declare a result codec the stack contributes. Raised while generating `contract.d.ts`. Payload: `operation`, `outputCodecId`.

### CONTRACT.CODEC_DESCRIPTOR_MISSING

The control plane resolves a codec referenced by the contract (a `CodecRef.codecId`) against the contract's pack stack and finds no registered codec descriptor for that id. Hit during control-plane operations (emit, migration tooling) when a contract references a codec no composed pack provides. Payload: `codecId`.

### CONTRACT.CAST_REFUSED

A value handed to a data type's cast, or to an authoring entry that reads written text, is not one that type takes: it is not in the shape the source type stores, its magnitude is outside the range the receiving type holds, the text is not a boolean, or the text is not a date or time the receiving type holds. A date or time text is refused when it has an offset its type does not hold or lacks one its type needs, has more fraction digits than its type holds (six, or three for `sqlite/datetime`, which holds milliseconds), names a date or time that does not exist, or is outside the range of years its type holds; the message shows text the type takes. The date and time codecs raise it from `encodeJson` for a value their type does not hold, such as a `Temporal` value with digits below one microsecond. Raised by a target's or extension's casts and authoring entries. A contract source reading a written value reports it to the author as the PSL diagnostic `PSL_INVALID_LITERAL` when a cast or an authoring entry raised it, and as `PSL_INVALID_DEFAULT_LITERAL` when a codec raised it for a column default. Payload: `why`, `fix`.

### CONTRACT.CHECK_NAME_RESERVED

An authored `@@check` / `check()`'s `name:` prefix matches the shape a derived enforcement check would use for a column of the same table (`<table>_<column>_check` or `<table>_<column>_elem_not_null`), so it cannot be told apart from a derived check once a non-`managed` table strips those. The message and `collidingColumns` meta name the column(s) whose derived-check shape the prefix matches. Raised while building a SQL contract, once the table's real columns are in hand. The fix is to choose a different `name:`. Payload: `tableName`, `prefix`, `collidingColumns`.

### CONTRACT.CHECK_ON_STI_VARIANT

A model declares `@@check` / `check()` but is a single-table-inheritance variant (`@@base` with no own `@@map`), so it shares its base model's storage table and has no table of its own to declare the check on. Raised while building a SQL contract, as a backstop for the TS authoring path; the PSL surface refuses this earlier, at interpretation, with a span-anchored `PSL_CHECK_ON_STI_VARIANT` diagnostic naming the base model. The fix is to declare the check on the base model instead. Payload: `tableName`, `modelName`.

### CONTRACT.CHECK_OPTOUT_INVALID

A `@noCheck` / `.noCheck(...)` declaration is invalid. Either it does not apply to the column: the named kind is not derivable for the column's shape (`membership` on a column with no domain-enum value set, `elementNotNull` on a column that is not a list of scalars), or the bare form waives nothing because the column derives no generated checks, or the declaration is malformed: a kind is named twice, or `noCheck()` is called more than once on one field builder. Raised by both authoring paths (TS `defineContract` and PSL interpretation) on `managed` tables. Payload: `modelName`, `fieldName`, `reason`, and `kind` for per-kind failures.

### CONTRACT.COLLECTION_INVALID

A Mongo model's collection attachment is wrong: the model declares `indexes`, `collectionOptions`, or `controlPolicy` but has no collection, or a single collection has `collectionOptions` / `controlPolicy` declared by more than one model. Raised by the Mongo `defineContract` builder. Payload: `modelName`, `collection`, `reason`.

### CONTRACT.CONSTRAINT_INVALID

A model declares an empty unique constraint (a unique with no fields), raised during SQL contract lowering (meta: `modelName`). Also raised when a CHECK constraint reaches SQLite migration DDL rendering: the SQLite target does not support CHECK constraints, and `sql.checkConstraint` is a Postgres-only capability. A `@@check` is refused earlier, by the PSL capability gate; a `check()` declared through the TypeScript builder is not, because capabilities reach the contract only after it is built, so this is where a SQLite `check()` is refused (meta: `constraintName`, and `tableName` where available).

### CONTRACT.PRINT_OUTPUT_IS_PROJECT_FILE

`prisma contract print --output` was asked to write over a file the project needs: the `prisma.config.ts` in the directory of the config that defines the `orm` section, or one of the files `contract emit` writes (the JSON `contract.output` names, and the `.d.ts` beside it). Writing there would put PSL where the CLI reads its config when `--config` names no other file, or the next `contract emit` would write over the printed PSL. The check compares the files the paths name: a path through a symbolic link, or one that differs only in case on a volume that ignores case, counts as the same file. Raised before the source is read, so nothing is written. Pick another `--output` path. Payload: `output` and `file`, both relative to the invocation directory.

### CONTRACT.PRINT_OUTPUT_IS_SOURCE

`prisma contract print --output` was asked to write over a file it reads: the resolved `--output` path is one of the contract source's inputs, or sits inside a directory of source files. Writing there would destroy the source the printed contract is made from. The same code is raised when the path names a new file that a glob input of the source would match once written, because the next `contract emit` would read the printed file together with the source files; `source` is then the glob. Pick another `--output` path, outside the files the config names. Raised before the source is read, so nothing is written and the source file is untouched. Payload: `output` and `source`, both relative to the invocation directory.

### CONTRACT.PRINT_UNSUPPORTED

`contract print` cannot write the loaded contract as Prisma 8 PSL that reads back as the same contract, so it writes nothing. The message names what it stopped on. Raised when the configured family cannot print a contract (no meta), or when the target's descriptor has no `buildPslContract` hook (meta: `targetId`). The Postgres printer raises it in each case below; each case is one function in its `psl-print/refusals.ts`, in this order. Every case is a contract that passes validation. The printer takes a validated contract and does not check its structure again.

- Column types and defaults:
  - no PSL type in the configured stack produces a column's codec, native type and type parameters, including a column that has no value for an argument its type constructor requires. Add the extension that contributes the type to the config (meta: `coordinate`, `nativeType`, `codecId`);
  - a string type argument holds a quote, backslash or line break, which the PSL source reads back differently (meta: `coordinate`, `argument`);
  - a domain enum column defaults to a value that is not a member of the enum (meta: `coordinate`, `pslTypeName`);
  - a column's literal default has no PSL literal that reads back as the stored value, including when the column's codec has no data type in the stack (meta: `coordinate`, `pslTypeName`).
- Generated values:
  - a column pairs the wall-clock-now generator with a different generator (meta: `coordinate`, `onCreate`, `onUpdate`);
  - a column generates a value on update other than through a temporal preset (meta: `coordinate`, `onCreate`, `onUpdate`);
  - a column is generated by a generator no PSL default function of the Postgres adapter produces (meta: `coordinate`, `onCreate`, `onUpdate`);
  - a column has both an id generator and a database default (meta: `coordinate`, `onCreate`);
  - a generated value names a column no field is stored in (meta: `coordinate`).
- Fields and columns:
  - a field and its column disagree where PSL writes them once: the field is optional and the column is not nullable or the reverse, a column of a single-table variant is not nullable, one of them is a list and the other is not, a scalar field's codec or type parameters differ from its column's (a column typed by a named type has that type's parameters), or they do not name the enum and value set the PSL source derives for a field typed by an enum (meta: `coordinate`);
  - a model field's or value-object member's type is a union of types (meta: `coordinate`, `kind`), or a field or member is a dictionary (meta: `coordinate`);
  - a value-object member typed by an enum names a value set other than the enum of the default namespace the PSL source derives, has a codec other than that enum's, or has type parameters (meta: `coordinate`);
  - a value-object member uses a codec that no Postgres codec in the configured stack names a native type for (meta: `coordinate`, `codecId`);
  - a value-object member uses a codec that names a native type only from type parameters the member does not carry (meta: `coordinate`, `codecId`);
  - a field is stored in no column (meta: `namespaceId`, `modelName`, `field`);
  - a model stores a column under a field name the model does not declare (meta: `namespaceId`, `modelName`, `field`);
  - a column is typed by a named type the contract does not declare, or its native type or codec is not the named type's (meta: `coordinate`, `typeRef`);
  - a column has its own control policy (meta: `coordinate`, `control`);
  - a table has no model stored in it (meta: `namespaceId`, `table`), or a column is stored by no field, other than the primary key columns that link a multi-table variant to its base (meta: `namespaceId`, `table`, `column`).
- Models:
  - a model has an owner (meta: `namespaceId`, `modelName`, `owner`);
  - a multi-table variant is linked to its base other than through the base's primary key columns as its unnamed primary key and an unnamed foreign key that cascades on delete (meta: `namespaceId`, `modelName`);
  - one model name is declared in more than one namespace (meta: `modelName`, `namespaces`);
  - a domain enum is declared outside the default namespace (meta: `namespaceId`, `names`);
  - a value object is declared outside the default namespace (meta: `namespaceId`, `names`).
- Keys, checks and indexes:
  - a check or index has a prefix, but its name is not that prefix followed by the hash of its content (meta: `namespaceId`, `table`, `name`, `prefix`);
  - a managed table lacks a check the PSL source derives for an enum or list column, or has a check with that check's name but not its prefix and expression (meta: `namespaceId`, `table`, `name`);
  - an index has options but no type (meta: `namespaceId`, `table`, `index`), or an option whose value is not a string (meta: `namespaceId`, `table`, `index`, `key`).
- Relations:
  - a to-one relation has no foreign key behind it (meta: `model`, `field`);
  - a foreign key has no relation that travels it (meta: `namespaceId`, `table`, `columns`);
  - a relation targets a model in another contract space, which the printer does not write yet (meta: `model`, `field`, `space`);
  - a many-to-many relation goes through a table whose model has no relation back to the relation's model (meta: `model`, `field`);
  - a one-to-many or one-to-one relation has no foreign key of its own, and the model it targets has no relation back that holds the foreign key (meta: `model`, `field`);
  - a relation names no fields to join on (meta: `model`, `field`).
- Enums and value sets:
  - a value set is not the value set of an enum or native enum of that name holding exactly its values, or an enum has no value set holding its members (meta: `namespaceId`, `name`);
  - an enum and a native enum would derive the same value set (meta: `namespaceId`, `name`);
  - a native enum has no value set holding its members (meta: `namespaceId`, `typeName`);
  - a native enum has its own control policy (meta: `namespaceId`, `typeName`, `control`).
- Namespaces, meta and roots:
  - a storage or domain namespace holds nothing PSL writes, or the contract lacks a namespace the PSL source would create, such as the default namespace (meta: `plane`, `namespaceId`);
  - a namespace is named `unbound` and is not the late-binding namespace, which PSL writes as `namespace unbound` (meta: `namespaceId`);
  - the contract has top-level `meta` entries (meta: `keys`);
  - the contract has roots other than one per model that is not a variant, keyed by its table name (meta: `root`).
- Row-level security:
  - a table has row-level security enabled but no model (meta: `namespaceId`, `table`);
  - a policy is on a table with no model (meta: `namespaceId`, `table`, `name`);
  - a policy is on a table without row-level security (meta: `namespaceId`, `table`, `name`);
  - a wire-named policy's name is not its block name followed by the hash of its content (meta: `namespaceId`, `table`, `name`);
  - a role is declared outside the unbound namespace (meta: `namespaceId`, `name`);
  - a row-level security setting or role is filed under a key the PSL source would not file it under (meta: `namespaceId`, `kind`, `name`);
  - a row-level security setting, role or policy records a namespace other than the one it is stored in (meta: `namespaceId`, `kind`, `name`).
- Names and storage entries:
  - a table or column is named `__proto__`, which the PSL source loses when it reads the name from `@@map` or `@map` (meta: `kind`, `name`);
  - a name PSL writes as an identifier is not one, or is `__proto__`: a namespace, model, field, value object, enum, enum member, native enum, named type, policy, role or index option key. `NaN` and `Infinity` are number words, not identifiers (meta: `kind`, `name`);
  - a namespace holds a storage entity kind other than tables, value sets, native enums, row-level security settings, policies and roles (meta: `namespaceId`, `kind`, `names`).

### CONTRACT.DATA_TYPE_CASTS_FROM_SQL_EXPRESSION

A data type in the composed stack declares a cast or a list cast from `sql/expression`: `Data type "<id>" from "<contributedBy>" declares a cast from sql/expression. No data type may cast from sql/expression: a sql literal is SQL the database runs, not a value of another type.` Such a cast would turn a `sql` literal into a value of another type with no diagnostic. Raised by the SQL family when it creates its control instance, which the CLI does before it emits, prints, infers, plans or verifies a contract. The language server does not create one and does not report it. Remove the cast from the component the message names. Payload: `dataType`, `contributedBy`.

### CONTRACT.DATA_TYPE_DUPLICATE

Two components in the composed stack register the same data type id, which has exactly one owner. Raised while assembling the stack's data types. Payload: `dataType`, `contributedBy`, `owner`.

### CONTRACT.DATA_TYPE_ENTRY_DUPLICATE

Two components contribute an authoring entry under the same key, so the stack cannot tell which one reads that data type's written form. Raised while merging authoring contributions. Payload: `key`, `contributedBy`, `owner`.

### CONTRACT.DATA_TYPE_ID_INVALID

A string given where a data type id belongs is not `owner/name` in lower case, or carries a version (a versioned id names a codec, not a data type). Raised by `dataTypeId()` while declaring a data type or a cast. Payload: `id`.

### CONTRACT.DATA_TYPE_NOT_WRITABLE

A data type declares a cast from a type no contract source can write, so the cast could never be exercised. Raised while checking the assembled data types. Payload: `dataType`, `source`, `contributedBy`.

### CONTRACT.DATA_TYPE_UNREGISTERED

Something names a data type that no component in the stack registers: a codec's `dataType`, an authoring entry's key, a type its number classifier returns, or a type a cast takes values of. Raised while checking the assembled data types. Payload: `dataType`, `contributedBy`.

### CONTRACT.DATA_TYPE_WRITTEN_FORM_DUPLICATE

Two authoring entries claim the same written form — the same literal tag, or the same plain string, boolean, or number syntax — so a written default would have two readers. Raised while checking the assembled data types. Payload: `claim`, `key`, `contributedBy`, `owner`, `ownerContributedBy`.

### CONTRACT.DEFAULT_INVALID

A field's default declaration is invalid: `defaultSql` is used on an enum field, a field declares both `default` and `executionDefaults`, or a field is nullable while carrying `executionDefaults` (`Field "<Model>.<field>" is filled on write by a generated default …, so it cannot be optional; remove .optional().`; the Mongo TypeScript builder words it around a preset such as `temporal.createdAt()`, refuses `.optional()` and `.many()` on such a field in the type, and says `remove .many()` for a list). Raised while authoring/building a SQL contract. Payload: `modelName`, `fieldName`, `reason`. The SQL TypeScript builder also raises it when the column's codec refuses the value passed to `.default(value)`, because the value is not the codec's input type (for example a string on `field.dateTime()`, whose codec takes a `Temporal.Instant`); TypeScript reports the same mistake as a type error when the field comes from the `defineContract` factory; the message carries the codec's own message, the original error is the `cause`, and the meta is `modelName`, `fieldName`, `codecId`, `reason: 'codec-refused-default'` and, for a list column, the 1-based `elementPosition`. It raises it too when the build has a codec lookup and no pack in the contract declares the column's codec, so the default cannot be checked (`reason: 'codec-not-found'`; list the pack that owns the codec in `extensions`), and when a list field has a default that is not an array (`reason: 'list-default-not-array'`). The Mongo TypeScript builder raises it for execution defaults it cannot key to one collection field: on a variant model's field (`reason: 'executionDefaults-on-variant'`; declare the field on the base model, whose defaults apply to every variant), or with different phases on two models stored in the same collection (`reason: 'executionDefaults-conflict'`; identical ones are merged). The PSL interpreter reports the same cases as `PSL_PRESET_ON_VARIANT_FIELD` and `PSL_PRESET_CONFLICT`. Also raised by the Postgres adapter's DDL renderer when a hand-authored `col(...)` pairs an `autoincrement()` default with a type that isn't `SERIAL`/`BIGSERIAL`/`SMALLSERIAL` (or their `SERIAL4`/`SERIAL8`/`SERIAL2` aliases). Meta in that case: `nativeType`. Also raised by the Postgres and SQLite DDL renderers for a literal default the column's codec refuses, which a `contract.json` an earlier version emitted, or a `migration.ts` it planned, can hold, and so can either file after a hand edit: `Column "<table>"."<column>" has a default its codec <codecId> refuses: <codec message>`, with meta `table`, `column`, `codecId`, `value` and `reason: 'codec-refused-default'`. Every DDL statement that writes a default reads it this way: a new table or column, a changed default, and on SQLite a rebuilt table. The Postgres renderer reads each element of a list default the same way; for a refused element the message says `has a default (element <n>)`, `value` is the element and the meta adds its 1-based `elementPosition`. `db init`, `db update` and `migration plan` report it as it is. For a `contract.json`, emit the contract again with the current version, and correct the default in the contract source if emit refuses it; for a `migration.ts`, correct the default in that file. Also raised by the SQLite adapter's DDL renderer for a `NaN` default on a column with no codec, which SQLite would store as NULL: `Column "<table>"."<column>" has a NaN default, which SQLite stores as NULL`, with meta `table`, `column`, `value: 'NaN'` and `reason: 'nan-default'`. Both DDL renderers raise it for an invalid `Date` default on a column with no codec: `Column "<table>"."<column>" has an invalid Date default`, with meta `table`, `column` and `reason: 'invalid-date-default'`. A NaN or infinite float default renders as `'NaN'::float8`, `'Infinity'::float8` or `'-Infinity'::float8` (the column's own float type) on Postgres, and an infinity as `9e999` or `-9e999` on SQLite, which introspection reads back as the infinity, so the applied default verifies. Also raised by the TypeScript `sql` template tag when the body cannot be canonicalized, with the same message as the PSL diagnostics `PSL_TAGGED_LITERAL_NUL` and `PSL_TAGGED_LITERAL_TOO_LARGE` (meta: `reason`, `offset`) or is exactly `now()` or `autoincrement()` (`` Write .default(now()) instead of sql`now()`; now() is a Prisma default function, not raw SQL. ``; meta: `reason: 'reserved-function'`, `expression`), or fails the SQL body check (`Default SQL must not contain semicolons, SQL comment tokens, dollar-quoting, or subqueries.`; meta: `reason: 'unsafe-sql'`, `expression`), and by the Postgres and SQLite DDL renderers when a function default fails that same check (`Unsafe default expression in contract: "<expression>"`; meta: `expression`). Both migration planners also raise it for a literal default in the contract that its column's data type refuses, such as a date without an offset on a `timestamptz` column, which a contract emitted by an earlier version can hold; the message carries the type's refusal and says to re-emit the contract (meta: `reason: 'default-not-canonical'`, `column`). `db update`, `db init` and `migration plan` report the planner's error under this code. Schema verification reports the same refusal as the explanation of the default's mismatch, or of its absence when the database has no default.

### CONTRACT.DEFAULT_SQL_INTERPOLATION

The TypeScript `sql` template tag was called with interpolated values: `` sql`...` does not support interpolation; write the SQL as one literal. `` Interpolation is already a type error (`...values: readonly never[]`); this is the runtime backstop. Meta: `interpolations` (how many values were passed).

### CONTRACT.ENTITY_KIND_INVALID

An entity attached to the contract declares a framework-wire namespace entry kind (`table` or `valueSet`), which only the framework itself may mint. Raised while building a SQL contract with pack-contributed entities. Payload: `entityKind`, `namespaceId`.

### CONTRACT.ENTITY_KIND_UNKNOWN

An entity handle passed to the contract has an `entityKind` that no composed pack registers, so the builder cannot lower it, or contract entries carry a kind no composed pack recognizes when the framework hydrates entities from an emitted contract. Raised during SQL contract lowering and entity hydration. Payload: `entityKind`.

### CONTRACT.ENUM_CODEC_NOT_IN_PACK_STACK

An enum declares a `codecId` that no family, target, or extension pack in the contract provides, so its member values cannot be encoded. Raised by both authoring paths (TS `defineContract` and PSL interpretation) when the codec lookup built from the contract's packs has no descriptor for the id. Payload: `codecId`.

### CONTRACT.ENUM_INVALID

An enum declaration is malformed: it has no members, a duplicate member name or value, or the declaration key in `defineContract({ enums })` does not match the `enumType` name. Raised while authoring a contract (framework `enumType`, SQL and Mongo builders). Payload: `enumName`, `member`, `reason`. The SQL TypeScript builder also raises it for a member whose value the enum's codec refuses, such as a `pg/char@1` member longer than one character, since the enum's column is `character`: `enumType("<name>") member "<member>" has a value its codec <codecId> refuses: <codec message>`, with `codecId` in the payload and `reason: 'codec-refused-member'`. Give the member a value the codec takes.

### CONTRACT.ENUM_UNKNOWN

A Mongo field references an enum that is not declared in `defineContract({ enums })`. Raised by the Mongo contract builder. Payload: `modelName`, `fieldName`, `enumName`.

### CONTRACT.EXPORT_INVALID

The TS contract module's export is not a plain JSON-serializable contract object: a non-object export, circular references, getters, or function-valued properties. Raised by the CLI while loading a TypeScript contract source. Payload: `path`, `reason`, `key`.

### CONTRACT.FIELD_UNKNOWN

An index or column mapping references a field the model does not declare (unknown field in the contract definition, or a Mongo model index over an undeclared field). Raised while lowering/building the contract. Payload: `modelName`, `fieldName`, `indexSignature`.

### CONTRACT.FOREIGN_KEY_INVALID

A foreign key's target refs are empty or inconsistent: no target ref given, refs point at different models, or compound refs disagree on `spaceId`, `namespaceId`, or `tableName`. Raised by the SQL contract DSL while declaring the FK. Payload: `mismatch`, `first`, `second`.

### CONTRACT.IDENTITY_INVALID

A model's identity is wrong: multiple fields marked `.id()`, identity declared both inline and in `.attributes(...)`, an empty identity, a model with non-owning relations but no id to anchor them, or an M:N target with no primary/unique key to derive junction columns from. Raised while lowering/building a SQL contract. Payload: `modelName`, `reason`.

### CONTRACT.IDENTIFIER_INVALID

A SQL identifier or literal fails escaping-safety checks while rendering DDL/SQL: an empty identifier, a null byte in an identifier or string literal, or a native enum label exceeding PostgreSQL's 63-byte limit. Raised by the Postgres and SQLite SQL utilities (formerly the `SqlEscapeError` class, removed at 0.17). Payload: `value`, `context`.

### CONTRACT.INDEX_INVALID

A Mongo variant model declares an index that conflicts with the discriminator scope of its variant, or a SQL index option value is not a string, finite number, or boolean. Raised by the Mongo contract builder and the Postgres index DDL renderer. Payload: `variantName`, `indexLabel`, `reason`, `key`.

### CONTRACT.INFER_UNSUPPORTED

`contract infer` is not available: either the configured family does not implement the `PslContractInferCapable` capability (no meta at that site), or the family supports inference but the database shape cannot be expressed yet: duplicate table names across schemas, a column typed by a native enum that an extension pack space already describes in another schema, or native enum adoption with content spanning multiple schemas. Meta at the shape sites: `tableName`, `columnName`, `schemas`.

### CONTRACT.INTROSPECTION_UNSUPPORTED

Introspection read an unrecognized or malformed database shape: an unknown referential action rule, or a malformed index reloption entry. Raised by the Postgres and SQLite control adapters. Payload: `rule`, `entry`, `indexName`.

### CONTRACT.INVALID_JSON_LITERAL

The text of a JSON default is not a JSON document, or holds a number outside the range a JSON number holds (`JSON.parse` reads such a numeral as `Infinity`, which `JSON.stringify` writes back as `null`). Raised while reading the text of a JSON default. Contract sources report it to the author as the PSL diagnostic `PSL_INVALID_LITERAL`. Payload: `why`, `fix`.

### CONTRACT.MARKER_MISMATCH

The contract hash does not match the marker (signature) stored in the database. `db verify` reports it as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`; the SQL runtime reports it as a warning during startup marker verification. Fix path: migrate the database or re-sign if the divergence is intentional. Payload: `expected`, `actual`.

### CONTRACT.MARKER_MISSING

No contract marker (database signature) is found in the database at all. `db verify` reports it as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`; the runtime reports it as a warning during startup marker verification. Fix path: `prisma db sign`. Payload: none notable.

### CONTRACT.MARKER_READ_FAILED

A driver-level failure occurred while reading the contract marker table: connectivity, permissions, or locking problems rather than bad marker content. Raised whenever a CLI/control operation reads the marker, and by the runtime when its first query on a database connection reads the marker (with the default `verifyMarker`) and that read fails; a query returned without `await` from an `await using` scope that held a serverless Postgres connection fails this way, with `DRIVER.NOT_CONNECTED` as its `cause`. Payload: `space`.

### CONTRACT.MARKER_REQUIRED

A command that requires a pre-signed database (marker present) as a precondition found none; also the default failure code stamped onto a non-ok verify result when no more specific code applies, which is how `db verify --strict` reports a database holding elements no contract declares. On `db verify` it is an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`; everywhere else it is a precondition failure at exit `2`. Those are two unrelated jobs for one code: "sign the database first" and "strict mode found elements no contract declares", and splitting them would let the exit code follow from the code alone. Fix path: run `prisma db init` first, or declare the extra elements in a contract. Payload: none notable.

### CONTRACT.MARKER_ROW_CORRUPT

The marker row exists but its column values fail schema validation: the row is corrupt or written by an incompatible version. Fix path: delete the row and re-sign with `prisma db sign`. Payload: `space`.

### CONTRACT.MODEL_BASE_MISSING

A variant model names a `base` that is not a model in the contract, so its type in `contract.d.ts` cannot include the base's fields. Raised while emitting `contract.d.ts`. Payload: `variant`, `base`.

### CONTRACT.MODEL_RELATION_TARGET_MISSING

A same-space relation points at a model the contract does not declare. Raised while emitting the `Models` namespace in `contract.d.ts`; only cross-space relations may reference models outside the contract. Payload: `owner`, `relationName`, `target` (`namespaceId`, `modelName`).

### CONTRACT.MODEL_TOKEN_INVALID

A model token is misused in the TS authoring DSL: an unnamed token is used in `.ref(...)` or as a relation target (tokens need `model("Name", ...)`), or a token is assigned under a `models` key that does not match its name. Payload: `tokenModelName`, `assignedKey`.

### CONTRACT.MODEL_TYPE_NAME_COLLISION

Two models produce the same emitted type name in the `Models` namespace of `contract.d.ts`, formed as `<namespace>_<Model>`, for example a `public_User` model beside a `public` namespace holding `User`, or a model named `AnyTask` beside a polymorphic base `Task`. Raised while emitting `contract.d.ts`. Payload: `memberName`, `sources`.

### CONTRACT.MODEL_TYPE_NAME_INVALID

An emitted model type name, formed as `<namespace>_<Model>`, is not a TypeScript identifier, for example because the namespace contains a hyphen. Raised while emitting `contract.d.ts`. Payload: `memberName`, `source`.

### CONTRACT.MODEL_UNKNOWN

A relation, foreign key, junction (`through`) reference, or context declaration names a model that is not declared in the contract. Raised while lowering/building a SQL contract. Payload: `sourceModel`, `relationName`, `targetModel`.

### CONTRACT.MODEL_VARIANT_MISSING

A polymorphic base names a variant that is not a model in the same namespace, so the `Any<Base>` union in `contract.d.ts` cannot be formed. Raised while emitting `contract.d.ts`. Payload: `base`, `variantName`.

### CONTRACT.MODULE_EXPORT_MISSING

The contract module at the configured path loads but exposes neither a `default` nor a `contract` export, so the CLI cannot obtain the contract from it. Raised when resolving a TS contract from config (SQL and Mongo). Payload: `path`.

### CONTRACT.NAME_DUPLICATE

Two declarations claim the same name: duplicate namespace entries, model names, value objects, relations, tables (two models mapping to one table, or duplicate table in a namespace), column mappings (two fields to one column), indexes, value-sets (enum and pack entity minting the same value-set), or pack entities of the same kind and name in one namespace. Raised while authoring/building a contract. Payload: `kind`, `name`, `namespaceId`, `first`, `second`.

### CONTRACT.NAMESPACE_INVALID

A namespace name is empty, whitespace-only, or a reserved sentinel (`__unbound__`, `__unspecified__`, or Postgres's reserved `unbound`), either in the declared `namespaces` list or on a model. Raised by the SQL contract builder. Payload: `namespace`, `reason`, `modelKey`.

### CONTRACT.NAMESPACE_UNKNOWN

A model references a namespace that is not in the contract's declared `namespaces` list. Raised by the SQL contract builder. Payload: `modelKey`, `namespace`, `declared`.

### CONTRACT.NAMESPACE_UNSUPPORTED

Namespaces are declared (contract-level list or a model-level `namespace`) on a target that has no schema/namespace concept, i.e. SQLite. Raised by the SQL contract builder. Payload: `namespaces`, `modelKey`, `targetId`.

### CONTRACT.NATIVE_TYPE_INVALID

A native type name in the contract fails the identifier-safety pattern required to render it into DDL. Raised by the Postgres and SQLite migration planners while building column DDL. Payload: `nativeType`.

### CONTRACT.PACK_CONTRIBUTION_INVALID

A composed pack's contribution is malformed or collides with another contribution; this is the extension-author-facing bucket. Covers: entity types colliding with reserved helper keys, duplicate entity kinds or index-type registrations, a registered entity kind with no `lowerEntityHandles` lowering, an invalid `indexTypes` shape, entries-slot collisions between a model attribute and a block entry kind, a model attribute that lowers to a malformed index, bad authoring-helper paths, a codec registered with an entity-ref arg but no `columnFromEntity` hook, and print-time contribution mismatches (a block keyword with no PSL block descriptor, or a descriptor whose discriminator disagrees with the block's kind). Raised during contract authoring/lowering and PSL printing. Payload: `packId`, `contribution`, `reason`, `keyword`, `paramName`, `codecId`.

### CONTRACT.PACK_FAMILY_MISMATCH

A pack passed to `defineContract` belongs to the wrong family: a non-SQL pack in a SQL contract (or non-Mongo in a Mongo contract), a target pack whose family disagrees with the contract's, or an extension pack from another family. Payload: `packId`, `packFamilyId`, `contractFamilyId`.

### CONTRACT.PACK_MISSING

A cross-space reference names a contract space that is not declared in the contract's `extensions`, so the space cannot be resolved. Raised during SQL contract lowering. Payload: `spaceId`, `context`.

### CONTRACT.PACK_REF_INVALID

Something other than an extension pack reference was passed in `defineContract`'s `extensions` list (e.g. a family or target pack). Payload: `packId`, `kind`.

### CONTRACT.PACK_TARGET_MISMATCH

An extension pack targets a different database target than the contract does (e.g. a Postgres-only extension pack in a SQLite contract). Raised by the SQL and Mongo contract builders. Payload: `packId`, `packTargetId`, `contractTargetId`.

### CONTRACT.POLICY_INVALID

An RLS policy declaration is invalid: it targets a model in another contract space, its prefix exceeds the length limit or is declared twice in one namespace, or it targets a table that is not RLS-enabled or not present in the namespace. Raised by the Postgres `defineContract` builder and while deriving the Postgres schema tree from the contract. Payload: `prefix`/`policyName`, `tableName`, `namespaceId`, `reason`.

### CONTRACT.RELATION_INVALID

A relation's shape is wrong: `.sql(...)` on a non-belongsTo relation, mismatched field counts between the two sides, an N:M relation without `through` metadata, or a relation target referencing a field of another model. Raised while authoring/building a contract (SQL and Mongo). Payload: `modelName`, `relationName`, `reason`.

### CONTRACT.ROLE_INVALID

A role entity is declared more than once in the entities list, or a role name is not a plain SQL identifier. Raised by the Postgres contract builder and RLS DDL rendering. Payload: `role`, `reason`.

### CONTRACT.SCHEMA_VERIFICATION_FAILED

Schema verification found that the live database schema does not satisfy the contract: missing/extra/mismatched tables, columns, or other elements. `db verify` and `db sign` both report it as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: for `db verify` that is the drift verdict, and for `db sign` it is the reason no signature was written. `db verify` raises one such diagnostic per contract space whose schema failed. Fix path: `prisma db update` or adjust the contract. Payload: `space` (the contract space, on `db verify`), `issues` (the drifted element paths); the underlying operation result also carries `verificationResult`.

### CONTRACT.SOURCE_IMPORT_DISALLOWED

The TypeScript contract module imports something outside the contract-source import allowlist; contract sources must stay pure so they can be bundled and evaluated deterministically. Raised by the CLI while loading a TS contract source. Payload: `allowlist`, `disallowed`.

### CONTRACT.SOURCE_DIAGNOSTIC

One finding a contract source reported with a code that is not yet dotted, such as the Prisma 8 PSL interpreter's `PSL_UNSUPPORTED_FIELD_TYPE` or a parser's `PSL_PARSE_ERROR`. This is its only producer case: it exists until those codes convert to dotted ones, and a source code that is already dotted, such as `PSL.PRISMA7_VIEW_UNSUPPORTED`, is reported under its own code instead. Never raised on its own; carried, one per such source diagnostic, in the `diagnostics` list of a `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED` error during `contract emit` or `contract print`, printed under it in the terminal and serialized as the envelope's `diagnostics` in JSON. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <source code>: <message>` (the location is omitted when the source gave none; a file the source names by its absolute path is shown relative to the working directory). `where` carries `path` and `line`. Payload: `code` (the source's own diagnostic code). A contract source's warnings, such as `PSL_DEPRECATED_SCALAR_NAME`, are reported the same way with severity `warn`, in the `diagnostics` of a successful `contract emit` or `contract print`; their `meta` also carries the source's `span`, whose `start` gives the line and column. Fix: edit the schema at each location the findings name, then run the command again. One such source code is `PSL_UNKNOWN_DEFAULT_FUNCTION`, reported by the Prisma 8 PSL interpreter for a `@default` function the composed stack does not register; its message lists the supported functions, and for the removed `dbgenerated(...)` it is `` Default function "dbgenerated" was removed. Write the SQL as a tagged literal: @default(sql`<expression>`). Supported functions: <list>. ``

### CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED

Loading the contract source failed: bundling or evaluating the TypeScript contract module (esbuild bundle error, or the module threw on import), the contract source provider returning a failure or a malformed result during `contract emit` or `contract print`, or `contract format` failing to read the PSL source file. The underlying failure is attached as `cause` where one exists. Payload: `path`, `stage` (`bundle` or `import`) at the TS-loader site; `diagnostics`, `issues`, `providerMeta` at the emit provider site; none at the format read site. At the emit provider site the error also carries a `diagnostics` list with one finding per source diagnostic: under the source's own code when it is dotted (for example `PSL.PRISMA7_VIEW_UNSUPPORTED`), otherwise as `CONTRACT.SOURCE_DIAGNOSTIC`.

### CONTRACT.TABLE_AMBIGUOUS

A storage table name resolves in more than one namespace of the contract and needs namespace qualification to disambiguate. Raised whenever a bare table name is resolved against contract storage (authoring and runtime paths). Payload: `tableName`, `candidates`.

### CONTRACT.TABLE_MISMATCH

A foreign key or index references a table name that disagrees with the table the target model is actually mapped to. Raised while building a SQL contract. Payload: `sourceModel`, `referencedTable`, `mappedTable`.

### CONTRACT.TARGET_MISMATCH

The contract's target does not match the target configured in `prisma.config.ts` (e.g. a Postgres contract with a SQLite config). `db verify` reports it as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`. Payload: `expected`, `actual`.

### CONTRACT.TYPE_UNKNOWN

A field references a storage type that cannot be resolved: a storage type instance not in `definition.types`, an unknown storage type name, or a field that never resolves to a storage descriptor. Raised during SQL contract lowering. Payload: `modelName`, `fieldName`, `typeRef`.

### CONTRACT.UNREADABLE

The emitted contract file could not be read or parsed while computing `migration status`; reported as a warn-severity diagnostic on the status result rather than a thrown error, with the hint to re-run `prisma contract emit`. Payload: none (diagnostic carries `message` and `hints`).

### CONTRACT.TYPES_RENDER_FAILED

A command advancing a ref (`db sign`, `db init`, `db update`, `db migrate --advance-ref`) could not render the `contract.d.ts` of the contract it is about to snapshot: the family accepted the JSON but the emitter refused it (for example a to-one relation with no declared nullability). Raised before the command touches the database, so nothing is migrated and no ref or snapshot is written; run `prisma contract emit` to see the emitter's own diagnosis. The emitter's error is attached as `cause`. Payload: none (`where.path` names the contract JSON).

### CONTRACT.VALIDATION_FAILED

Aggregate contract validation failed: structural validation of the contract JSON (`ContractValidationError` with a `phase` of structural/domain/storage), semantic validation during `buildContract`, or storage/model validators rejecting the built contract. Raised at emit/authoring time and whenever a contract is loaded and validated. Also raised by `migration new` when the emitted contract has no `storageHash`; that site has no meta. Payload: `errors` (aggregate site); the error class also carries `phase`.

### CONTRACT.VERIFY_FAILED

`db verify` failed for a reason the verify result did not classify under a more specific code (marker, target, or schema-verification codes). Reported as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`, with the verify result's own text as the summary. Payload: none.

### CONTRACT.WIRE_NAME_PREFIX_TOO_LONG

An authored wire-name prefix (an index name, an RLS policy prefix, or a check's `name:` prefix) exceeds the 54-byte maximum: Postgres identifiers cap at 63 bytes and the wire name appends a 9-byte `_<8hex>` content-hash suffix. Raised at contract lowering. Payload: `prefix`, `maxBytes`.

## PSL

### PSL.FORMAT_OPTION_INVALID

`resolveFormatOptions` was given an invalid formatting option: a non-positive/non-integer `indent` or an unrecognized `newline` value. Raised before any PSL source is read. Payload: `option`, `received`.

### PSL.PARSE_FAILED

`format()` was asked to format PSL source that has parse errors; formatting refuses to run on an unparseable document. The message carries the first diagnostic and a count of the rest; the CLI `contract format` command wraps this into a structured failure telling the user to fix the parse errors, attaching the parser error as `cause`. Payload: `diagnostics`.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_COMPOSITE_ID_UNSUPPORTED

`@@id` on a model; a MongoDB document is identified by its `_id` field alone. Declare the id as `id String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId`. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_COMPOSITE_INDEX_PATH_UNSUPPORTED

An `@@index`, `@@unique`, or `@@fulltext` path that reaches into a composite type, such as `address.city` or `address.city(sort: Asc)`, which the Mongo contract cannot express yet. Index a top-level field or remove the index; either change also reaches the Prisma 6 app, whose `db push` builds its indexes from the schema. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_COMPOSITE_MAP_UNSUPPORTED

`@map` on a field of a composite `type`, which the Mongo contract cannot express yet. Removing `@map` renames the stored field, so keep the schema until Prisma 8 supports it. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_CONTRACT_INVALID

The Prisma 6 MongoDB schema gives a contract that Prisma 8 rejects, for a cause the source has no specific diagnostic for: a structured error was thrown while the contract was built, or the contract failed the domain or storage check. This is a bug in Prisma ORM; the message names the cause, and the user should report it with the schema. Reported at the schema path by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file> <message>` (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path`. Payload: none; the error's `providerMeta` carries `schemaPath` and the thrown error's `code`.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_DEFAULT_UNSUPPORTED

A `@default` other than `now()` on a `DateTime` field and `auto()` on the id: a literal, `uuid()`, `cuid()`, `dbgenerated(...)`, `now()` on another type, or `auto()` on another field. MongoDB has no stored defaults, and Prisma 8 fills only `now()`. The Prisma 6 client fills the default today, so the message says what removing it does to the Prisma 6 app: a required field must then be passed to every Prisma 6 create call, and an optional or list field no longer gets the default. Set the value in application code, then remove the default. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_ID_NOT_OBJECTID

The model's `@id` is not a required `String @db.ObjectId` stored as `_id`. Declare it as `id String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId`. Stored documents keep their `_id` values, so a model whose stored `_id` values are not ObjectIds cannot use the source until they, and every field that refers to them, are rewritten. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_IGNORED_FIELD_REFERENCED

An `@ignore`d field is used by `@unique`, `@@unique`, `@@index`, `@@fulltext`, or a relation's `fields:` or `references:`, and Prisma 6 still creates that index or reads that key. Remove `@ignore` from the field, which adds it to the Prisma 6 client, or remove what uses it: removing an index makes Prisma 6 `db push` drop it, and removing a relation field removes that relation from the Prisma 6 client. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_INDEX_ARGUMENT_UNSUPPORTED

An index argument a Mongo contract index cannot carry, such as `length`, an unknown argument, or a dotted path whose first segment is not a composite-type field (`title.first`), which Prisma 6 refuses as an unknown field. `sort` is read, and `map` and `name` are accepted and dropped, since Mongo verify matches indexes by keys and options. Remove the argument. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_LIST_RELATION_UNSUPPORTED

A list relation whose keys live in a list field (a many-to-many relation on MongoDB), which Prisma 8 does not support yet. Remove the relation fields and keep the key list as a plain field; the Prisma 6 client then loses the relation fields too, so Prisma 6 code that uses them has to use the key list. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_NATIVE_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED

A `@db.*` attribute the source does not read. The source reads every native type Prisma 6.19 accepts on MongoDB, as the codec for the BSON type it stores, except `DateTime @db.Timestamp`: Prisma 8 has no codec for a BSON timestamp. Remove it; the message says that the Prisma 6 client then stores new values as BSON date, and that documents already stored keep their timestamp values until they are rewritten as dates. An attribute Prisma 6 itself rejects on that field type is named as such. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_OPTIONAL_GENERATED_FIELD_UNSUPPORTED

`@default(now())` or `@updatedAt` on an optional field. Make the field required once every stored document has a value, or remove the attribute and set the value in application code. Either fix also changes the Prisma 6 app: the Prisma 6 client fails on a stored document that lacks a required field, and without the attribute it no longer fills the field. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_PROVIDER_MISMATCH

The Prisma 6 schema has no `datasource` block, or its `provider` is not `mongodb`. Use the source only with a MongoDB schema. The source stops at this finding and reports nothing about the models, so the only other findings are parse errors. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_REFERENTIAL_ACTION_UNSUPPORTED

`onDelete`, `onUpdate`, or `map` on `@relation`. Prisma 8 enforces no referential actions on MongoDB, and MongoDB has no foreign key constraint for `map` to name. The Prisma 6 client emulates referential actions, so removing `onDelete` or `onUpdate` can change the Prisma 6 app: its client then applies its default, `Restrict` for `onDelete` on a required relation (deleting a parent that still has children fails with P2014), `SetNull` for `onDelete` on an optional one (the children's key is set to null), and `Cascade` for `onUpdate`. The message names the default and its effect, or says nothing changes when the argument already names the default. Handle related documents in application code, then remove the argument. Removing `map` changes nothing in the Prisma 6 app. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_SCHEMA_READ_FAILED

The schema path could not be read, or the schema directory holds no `.prisma` file. When nothing exists at the path, the message says so and names `prisma6Schema()` in `prisma.config.ts` as the place to fix it. Reported at the schema path by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file> <message>` (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path`. Payload: none; the error's `providerMeta` carries the schema path.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_SCHEMA_UNSUPPORTED

`@@schema` on a model or enum; a MongoDB contract has one database, bound by the connection string. Remove `@@schema`. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_TEXT_INDEX_LIMIT

A model with more than one `@@fulltext`; MongoDB allows one text index per collection. Merge the fields into one `@@fulltext`. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE

An attribute the source does not read. Remove it. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_UNSUPPORTED_TYPE

A field of type `Unsupported("...")`, which has no Prisma 8 codec, or of a type name that is not a scalar type, enum, composite type, or model. For `Unsupported`, Prisma 6 rejects `@ignore` on the field; remove the field, or add `@@ignore` to the model, which also needs `@ignore` on every relation field that points to it. For an unknown name, correct the type name. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_UPDATED_AT_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED

`@updatedAt` on a field that is not a `DateTime`. Removing it also stops the Prisma 6 client from setting the field on every update; set the value in application code, then remove `@updatedAt`. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA6_MONGO_VIEW_UNSUPPORTED

A `view` block; Prisma 8 has no views on MongoDB. Remove the view from the schema the source reads; the Prisma 6 client then loses the view's model too. Reported by the Prisma 6 MongoDB contract source (`prisma6Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_CONTRACT_INVALID

The Prisma 7 schema gives a contract that Prisma 8 rejects, for a cause the source has no specific diagnostic for: a structured error was thrown while the contract was built, or the contract failed the domain, storage consistency, or model storage reference check. This is a bug in Prisma ORM; the message names the cause, and the user should report it with the schema. Reported at the schema path by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none; the error's `providerMeta` carries `schemaPath` and the thrown error's `code`.

### PSL.PRISMA7_ENUM_NAMESPACE_MISMATCH

A field uses an enum declared under a different `@@schema`; a Postgres enum lives in one schema and a Prisma 8 column references the enum of its own namespace. Declare the enum in the model's schema, or move the model. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_IGNORED_FIELD_REFERENCED

An `@ignore`d field is used by `@id`, `@unique`, `@@id`, `@@unique`, `@@index`, or a relation's `fields:`, and Prisma 7 still creates that key, index, or foreign key over its column. Remove `@ignore` from the field. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_INDEX_ARGUMENT_UNSUPPORTED

An index argument Prisma 8 indexes cannot carry (`sort`, `length`, `ops`, an unknown index type), a dotted path such as `title.length` (Prisma 7 refuses it as an unknown field), or an indexed field that is not a column. Remove the argument, or list fields of the model by name. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_JSON_NULL_DEFAULT_UNSUPPORTED

A `Json` default of `"null"`, or a `Json[]` default holding it: the contract cannot tell the JSON value null apart from SQL `NULL`. Remove the `@default` or give it another JSON value. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_JUNCTION_ID_UNSUPPORTED

An implicit many-to-many relation on a model without a single-field `@id`. Give the model a single-field `@id`, or write the junction model out. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_JUNCTION_NAME_COLLISION

A model in the same schema as an implicit many-to-many junction has the junction model's name (`PostToTag`, or the relation name). Rename the model and keep its table with `@@map`. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_NATIVE_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED

A `@db.*` type with no Prisma 8 codec (`Citext`, `Bit`, `VarBit`, `Xml`, `Oid`, `Money`, or an unknown spelling). Add `@ignore` to the field when no key, index, or relation uses it, or `@@ignore` to the model. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_OPTIONAL_GENERATED_FIELD_UNSUPPORTED

An ORM-side generator such as `@default(uuid())`, or `@updatedAt`, on an optional field. Remove the generator or `@updatedAt` and keep the `?`. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_PROVIDER_MISMATCH

The Prisma 7 schema has no `datasource` block, or its `provider` is not one the target accepts (`postgresql` or `postgres` for Postgres). Use the source only with a schema for the configured target. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_REFERENTIAL_ACTION_UNSUPPORTED

`SetNull` on a relation over a required foreign key field, or `SetDefault` over a required field with no column default. Make the fields optional, give them a column default, or choose another action. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_RELATION_MODE_UNSUPPORTED

`relationMode = "prisma"`, or the older `referentialIntegrity = "prisma"`. Remove it or set `relationMode = "foreignKeys"`. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_RELATION_NAME_SHARED

Two or more implicit many-to-many relations in the same schema use the same relation name; Prisma 7 creates one table for all of them, wired to only one. Give each relation its own name. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_RELATION_UNRESOLVED

A relation field that cannot be paired: no matching side, an ambiguous unnamed pair, a singular back-relation over a non-unique foreign key, a `fields`/`references` mismatch, or a required relation field over an optional foreign key field. Name both sides with `@relation("name")`, add the missing `fields`/`references`, or make the relation field optional. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_SCHEMA_READ_FAILED

The schema path could not be read, or the schema directory holds no `.prisma` file. When nothing exists at the path, the message says so and names `prisma7Schema()` in `prisma.config.ts` as the place to fix it. Reported at the schema path by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none; the error's `providerMeta` carries the schema path.

### PSL.PRISMA7_TABLE_COLLISION

Two models map to the same table in one schema, or a model maps to the table of an implicit many-to-many relation. Give each model its own table with `@@map`. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE

An attribute Prisma 7 for the target does not have, or one the source does not read (`@@fulltext`, `@shardKey`). Remove it. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_UNKNOWN_DEFAULT

A `@default` value the source cannot read, or one the column's data type or codec refuses. The message is `Field "<Model>.<field>": @default <reason>`. Every reason below carries ` at element <n>` after the value it is about when that value is one element of a list. The reasons that come from reading the value are: `holds text that this contract source does not read: <the reading entry's message>`; `holds a <tag> literal, which this stack does not register.`; `holds a <string|boolean|number> value, which this target has no data type for.`; `holds a <value type> value, which <column type> has no cast from; it casts from <types>.` (or `it casts from nothing`); and `holds a value that <codecId> does not read: <the codec's message>`. The rest do not involve the value's type — an unknown function, an enum member on a non-enum field or a non-member, and a `dbgenerated(...)` argument list that is not a single positional string with text in it. Write a value of a type the column's type is or casts from, an enum member, or a supported function. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_UNSUPPORTED_TYPE

`Unsupported("...")` or an unknown field type. Add `@@ignore` to the model, or correct the type name. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_UPDATED_AT_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED

`@updatedAt` on a column whose codec has no "now" generator in the target, such as `@db.Date`. Remove `@updatedAt`. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_UPDATED_AT_WITH_DEFAULT_UNSUPPORTED

`@updatedAt` combined with `@default`. Remove the `@default`; `@updatedAt` still sets the value on create and update. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL.PRISMA7_VIEW_UNSUPPORTED

A `view` block; Prisma 8 has no views. Remove the view, or replace it with a model over the underlying table. Reported by the Prisma 7 contract source (`prisma7Schema`) during `contract emit` or `contract print`, as a finding in the `diagnostics` list of `CONTRACT.SOURCE_LOAD_FAILED`, never on its own. `summary` is `<file>:<line>:<column> <message>`, with only the file when there is no position (the terminal prints the code before it), and `where` carries `path` and, when known, `line`. Payload: none.

### PSL_BACKTICK_STRING_REQUIRES_TAG

A backtick string appears somewhere other than after a tag, for example `` @map(`x`) `` or `` provider = `x` ``: `` A backtick string must follow a tag, as in tag`...`. `` Reported at the string. Write a `"` or `'` string there, or put the tag in front of it, as in `` @default(sql`...`) ``.

### PSL_UNKNOWN_LITERAL_TAG

A tagged literal uses a tag no pack in the stack registered: `Unknown literal tag "<tag>". Known tags: <tags in registration order>.` The SQL family registers `sql`, and every SQL target registers `json`. `pg.sql` and `sqlite.sql` are not registered; write `sql`. Reported at the literal.

### PSL_DEPRECATED_SCALAR_NAME

A warning, not an error: a Mongo schema types a field with a deprecated scalar name, `Int`, `Float`, `Boolean` or `DateTime`: `Scalar type "<old>" is deprecated and will be removed; use "<new>" (stored as BSON <bsonType>).` Reported at the type through the contract source's `reportWarning`; `prisma contract emit` prints it and still writes the contract, which is the same as the new name gives, and the language server shows it with warning severity. Rename the type to `Int32`, `Double`, `Bool` or `Date`.

### PSL_PRESET_WITHOUT_EFFECT

A warning, not an error: a Mongo schema uses a field preset that fills nothing, such as `temporal.timestamp()` with neither phase: `Field "<Model>.<field>" uses temporal.timestamp() without onCreate or onUpdate, so nothing fills it and it is stored exactly like Date. Write Date, or pass onCreate: now or onUpdate: now.` Reported at the preset call through the contract source's `reportWarning`; the contract is written as for `Date`.

### PSL_VALUE_TYPE_INCOMPATIBLE

A written value has a data type the receiving type neither is nor casts from. For a `@default` the receiving type is the column's: `Field "<Model>.<field>": <column type> has no cast from <value type>; it casts from <types>`, or `; it casts from nothing` when the column's type declares no cast at all. A written value has a data type of its own — a number's comes from its own size and precision, so on Postgres `42` is `pg/int2` and `100000000000000099` is `pg/int8` — and a data type declares which other types' values it takes. Inside a written list the message names the element: `Field "<Model>.<field>" at element 2: ...`. A list written on a column that holds one value, and a `sql` literal inside a list literal, are reported the same way.

The same code reports a written form this target has no data type for at all: `Field "<Model>.<field>"[ at element <n>]: this target has no data type for a <string|boolean|number> value` — `true` on SQLite, for instance, which registers no boolean entry.

The same code reports a literal default on a field typed by a composite type that does not have the composite type's shape. The path starts at `<Model>.<field>` and names each member with `.<member>` and each list element with `[<index>]`; `<kind>` is `a JSON object`, `a JSON array`, `a JSON string`, `a JSON number`, `a JSON boolean` or `null`:

- `Field "<Model>.<field>": the default of a value object is a JSON object, not <kind>`, and `the default of a list of value objects is a JSON array, not <kind>`. JSON `null` is taken when the field is optional.
- `Field "<path>": a value of "<Type>" is a JSON object, not <kind>`, for an element of a list or a nested member.
- `Field "<path>": "<key>" is not a member of "<Type>"`.
- `Field "<path>": the member is required, and the default has no value for it`.
- `Field "<path>": the member is not optional, so its value is not null`, and `an element of the member is not null` for a list member. A member typed by the stack's JSON type takes `null` as a value.
- `Field "<path>": the member is a list, so its value is a JSON array, not <kind>`.

A member value its codec refuses, or a value outside an enum member's enum, is `PSL_INVALID_DEFAULT_LITERAL`.

Reported at the `@default` attribute. See [ADR 254](../architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20254%20-%20Data%20types%20and%20casts.md).

### PSL_INVALID_LITERAL

A written value that the authoring entry's parse or a cast refused: a magnitude no double holds written on a `Float` column, a text a tag's parse cannot read, such as the text of a `json` literal that is not a JSON document, or a number no data type of the target holds — `no data type of this target holds the number <text>`, which is how SQLite refuses a whole number past 64 bits. The message is `Field "<Model>.<field>": <the message of whatever refused it>`, with ` at element <n>` after the field path when it is one element of a written list. Reported at the `@default` attribute. See [ADR 254](../architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20254%20-%20Data%20types%20and%20casts.md).

### PSL_DEFAULT_LIST_EXPECTED

A single value is written as the `@default` of a column that holds a list: `Field "<Model>.<field>": this column holds a list, so its default is a list literal, as in [1, 2]`. Every other mismatch between a written value and a column's type is `PSL_VALUE_TYPE_INCOMPATIBLE`. Reported at the `@default` attribute.

### PSL_INVALID_DEFAULT_LITERAL

A written `@default` value that the column's codec refused, such as a `pgvector.Vector(3)` column given two elements. The message is `Field "<Model>.<field>": <the codec's message>`, with ` at element <n>` after the field path when it is one element of a written list. A value the authoring entry's parse or a cast refused is `PSL_INVALID_LITERAL`. The same code reports a member value of a value-object default that the member's codec does not read, as in `Field "User.home.price": pg/numeric@1 JSON value must be a decimal string`; the default holds each member in the form its codec stores, so a `Decimal` or `BigInt` member takes a decimal string, and a `String` member a JSON string. It also reports a value of a member typed by an enum that is not one of the enum's values: `Field "<path>": Expected one of: <values>`, each value as its codec stores it, JSON-encoded. Reported at the `@default` attribute. See [ADR 254](../architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20254%20-%20Data%20types%20and%20casts.md).

### PSL_TAGGED_LITERAL_NUL

A tagged literal's body contains a NUL character: `Tagged literals must not contain NUL characters.` Reported at the literal, at every place that takes a tagged literal.

### PSL_TAGGED_LITERAL_TOO_LARGE

A tagged literal's text, which is its body after canonicalization, is larger than 65536 UTF-8 bytes: `Tagged literal exceeds 65536 bytes.` Reported at the literal, at every place that takes a tagged literal.

### PSL_LIST_AUTOINCREMENT_UNSUPPORTED

A list column declares `@default(autoincrement())`: `Field "<Model>.<field>" is a list and cannot use autoincrement(); it is a Prisma marker for a sequence-backed scalar column, not SQL.` Every other storage default lowers on a list column. Reported at the attribute.

### PSL_INVALID_DEFAULT_SQL

A `` @default(sql`...`) `` text fails the check `@default` runs on raw SQL: `Default SQL must not contain semicolons, SQL comment tokens, dollar-quoting, or subqueries.` (the rule the migration planners apply at DDL time, run at authoring time so it has a source span), or is exactly `now()` or `autoincrement()`: `` Write @default(now()) instead of sql`now()`; now() is a Prisma default function, not raw SQL. `` The tag is always `sql`. Only `@default` reports this code. Reported at the literal.

### PSL_UNSUPPORTED_ENUM_MEMBER_ATTRIBUTE

An enum member carries an attribute, as in `USER @map("user")`: `enum "<Enum>": member "<member>" carries @<attribute>, but an enum member takes no attributes`. Reported by the SQL and Mongo PSL readers, once per attribute, at the attribute. Remove the attribute. To store a value other than the member's name, write it as the member's value, as in `USER = "user"`.

### PSL_UNSUPPORTED_COMPOSITE_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE

A composite type carries a block attribute, as in `@@map("addresses")` inside a `type` block: `Composite type "<Type>" uses attribute "@@<attribute>", which a composite type does not take`. An attribute on one of its members is `PSL_UNSUPPORTED_FIELD_ATTRIBUTE`: `Member "<member>" of composite type "<Type>" uses attribute "@<attribute>", which a composite type member does not take`. Reported by the SQL PSL reader, once per attribute, at the attribute. Remove the attribute. To give a value object a default, write it on the model field as a whole value, as in `` home Address @default(json`{"street": "x"}`) ``.

### PSL_PRESET_ON_VARIANT_FIELD

A Mongo field preset that sets execution defaults, such as `temporal.createdAt()`, is declared on a field of a polymorphic variant model (one with `@@base`): `Preset "<preset>" on variant "<Model>" field "<field>": execution defaults apply to every document in collection "<collection>", so declare them on the base model.` Execution defaults are keyed by collection and field, so a default on one variant would also fill that field on the base model and every sibling variant. Declare the field on the base model; variants inherit it. Reported at the preset.

### PSL_PRESET_CONFLICT

Two Mongo models stored in the same collection declare field presets with different execution defaults for the same stored field, for example `temporal.createdAt()` on one and `temporal.updatedAt()` on the other. Execution defaults are keyed by collection and field, so the collection can have only one. Identical presets are merged. Use the same preset on both models. Reported at the second preset.

## ORM

### ORM.AGGREGATE_OPERATION_RESERVED

A contributed aggregate operation carries a name a collection builder member already owns (`select`, `include`, `where`, `combine`, `aggregate`, …, or a collection instance field). Aggregate operations surface as reducer methods on the ORM collection, in one flat namespace with the query-builder members, so a same-named operation would shadow the member it collides with. Raised at ORM composition (`orm(...)`), where the collection surface is assembled. Rename the contributed operation. Payload: `operation`.

### ORM.AGGREGATE_PROJECTION_ONLY

An aggregate operation contributed from outside the closed SQL aggregate alphabet (`count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`) was used in HAVING, ORDER BY, or another comparison position. Such an operation reaches SQL only through its descriptor's lowering hook, a rendering meant for the SELECT projection, where the value crosses the driver boundary. HAVING and ORDER BY compare the value inside the database, where that rendering would change SQL semantics (a textual rendering compares and sorts lexicographically), so the query builder refuses at authoring time. Project the aggregate in a select and filter or order on the projected value, or use an operation from the alphabet. Payload: `operation`.

### ORM.AGGREGATE_SELECTOR_INVALID

An `aggregate()` or `groupBy().aggregate()` selector is not a valid aggregation descriptor, or an aggregate function that requires a column/field (e.g. sum, avg) was given none. Thrown when the ORM client builds the aggregate query plan. Payload: `method`, `model`, `alias`, `fn`.

### ORM.AGGREGATE_SELECTOR_MISSING

`aggregate()` or `groupBy().aggregate()` was called with zero aggregation selectors; at least one is required. Payload: `method`, `model` (or `namespaceId`, `tableName`).

### ORM.AGGREGATE_UNSUPPORTED

An aggregate was invoked for an operation/input pair the composed target declares no descriptor for: an undeclared pair has no result identity to type or decode, so it is rejected before any SQL is built rather than executed into a driver-native value. Raised by ORM aggregate planning and decoding, and by the SQL-builder lane's aggregate functions; the typed surfaces already make such a call a type error, so reaching this at runtime means a dynamic or cast invocation. Payload: `operation`, plus `table`/`column`/`inputCodecId` where an input is involved. Contribute an aggregate descriptor for the pair, or aggregate an input the target declares.

### ORM.ARGUMENT_INVALID

A method argument on the ORM client, or on the `sql()` / Mongo query-builder DSLs, is malformed or missing a required part: a `null` where-arg, `upsert()` without conflict columns or without a create value for a conflict column, a custom collection registered as an instance / against a nonexistent model in `orm({ collections })`, invalid builder argument shapes, `$and`/`$or` with no expressions, a limit, offset or skip that is negative or not an integer, or malformed lookup/group/update specs. For SQL, the limit/offset check runs in relational-core when the `SelectAst` is constructed, so every SQL lane and target raises it before any SQL is rendered. That check also refuses integers above `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, and does not check a limit or offset bound as a parameter. Payload: `method`, `argument` (`limit` or `offset` for the SQL limit/offset check), `model`, `column`, `key`.

### ORM.CAPABILITY_MISSING

The requested operation requires a contract capability the contract does not declare, currently the `returning` capability needed for mutations that read back the affected row. Raised by the ORM client and the `sql()` builder. Payload: `capability`, `action`.

### ORM.COLUMN_UNKNOWN

A mutation payload or where-expression references a column that does not exist on the resolved table. Thrown while compiling the query plan or binding the where clause, by the ORM client and by the `sql()` builder DSL. Payload: `namespaceId`, `tableName`, `column`.

### ORM.CURSOR_VALUE_MISSING

Cursor pagination was requested but the cursor object lacks a value for one of the `orderBy` columns, so the position cannot be anchored. Payload: `column`.

### ORM.FIELD_IMMUTABLE

A Mongo mutation payload attempts to write `_id`, which is immutable. Thrown by the Mongo ORM client for create/update/upsert payloads. Payload: `field`.

### ORM.FIELD_UNKNOWN

A shorthand relation filter references a field that is not defined on the related model. Thrown by the SQL ORM client while resolving the filter. Payload: `model`, `field`.

### ORM.FILTER_UNSUPPORTED

A shorthand equality filter targets a field whose codec does not support equality comparisons (lacks the equality trait). Payload: `model`, `field`, `trait`.

### ORM.GROUP_BY_FIELD_MISSING

`groupBy()` was called with zero fields; at least one grouping field is required. Payload: `namespaceId`, `tableName`.

### ORM.HAVING_EXPRESSION_UNSUPPORTED

A `groupBy().having()` expression uses a kind the grouped-having compiler does not allow: `ParamRef`/`PreparedParamRef`, list values, non-aggregate expressions, or another unsupported comparable kind. Only aggregate metric expressions are supported. Payload: `kind`.

### ORM.INCLUDE_INVALID

An `include()` usage is structurally invalid: the refinement callback returned something that is not a collection, include-scalar selector, or `combine()` descriptor; a `combine()` branch is invalid or empty; or an include-only action was called outside an `include()` refinement callback. Payload: `relation`, `branch`, `action`.

### ORM.INCLUDE_UNSUPPORTED

The include is well-formed but not supported in this position: scalar aggregations or `combine()` on a to-one relation (SQL), or including an embed relation / compound reference (Mongo; only reference relations can be included). Payload: `relation`, `kind`, `model`.

### ORM.MODEL_UNKNOWN

The Mongo ORM client was asked to operate on a model name that is not in the contract (collection compile, or a raw-pipeline root bound to an unknown model). Payload: `model`, `root`.

### ORM.MUTATION_DATA_MISSING

`create()` or `createAndCount()` was called with zero rows; at least one row of data is required. Payload: `method`, `namespaceId`, `tableName`.

### ORM.MUTATION_DEFAULTS_MISSING

`mongoOrm()` was built over a contract with execution defaults (fields such as `temporal.createdAt()` that the ORM fills on write) without `mutationDefaults`, so those fields would never be written. Pass the execution context, `mongoOrm({ contract, executor, mutationDefaults: context })`, or create the client with `mongo()`. Payload: `fields` (`<collection>.<field>` for each default).

### ORM.MUTATION_ROW_MISSING

A mutation that expected the database to return a row got none: `create()`/`upsert()` read-back, MTI base or variant INSERT, or a nested create. The Prisma-classic analogue of P2025. Payload: `operation`, `model`, `tableName`, `phase`.

### ORM.OPERATION_UNSUPPORTED

A valid ORM method was called in a configuration that does not support it: mutating an MTI variant collection with a method that requires `createAll()`, passing `onConflict: 'skip'` to `createAll()` on an MTI variant collection, Mongo `upsert()` with dot-path field operations, a Mongo `upsert()` whose `create` sets a field that has an update default and whose update pulls by a match document (that upsert runs as one update pipeline, which can pull only a single value), or a Mongo mutation carrying windowing (`orderBy`/`offset`/`limit`) or includes. Payload: `method`, `model`, `reason`, `field`.

### ORM.RELATION_LINK_DUPLICATE

A `connect()` nested mutation violated a unique constraint on the junction table: the junction link is likely already present. The original driver error is preserved as `cause`. Payload: `relation`, `junction`.

### ORM.RELATION_MUTATION_INVALID

A nested relation mutation's input is malformed: a relation field without a mutator callback or returning an invalid descriptor, `create` without data, `connect`/`disconnect` with a missing or empty criterion, duplicate connect criteria resolving to the same junction link, or conflicting values for a junction column. Payload: `kind`, `relation`, `model`, `problem`, `junction`, `column`.

### ORM.RELATION_MUTATION_UNSUPPORTED

A nested relation mutation kind is not supported in this position: `disconnect()` outside `update()` nested mutations, or `create()`/`connect()` through a junction table with required columns the relation API cannot populate (`disconnect()` stays available). Payload: `kind`, `relation`.

### ORM.RELATION_ROW_MISSING

A `connect()`/`disconnect()` nested mutation's criterion matched no row on the related model. Payload: `kind`, `relation`.

### ORM.RELATION_UNKNOWN

A referenced relation name does not exist on the model, in `include()` (SQL and Mongo) or when resolving relation metadata from the contract. Payload: `model`, `relation`.

### ORM.ROW_IDENTITY_MISSING

The operation needs a primary key or unique constraint the table does not have: `update()`/`delete()` targeting a single row, a `create()` or `update()` with nested relation mutations (which updates and reloads the row by that key), or keying the include read-back after a mutation. Payload: `model`, `table`.

### ORM.TABLE_UNKNOWN

The table a collection resolves to does not exist in the contract's storage for the namespace. Thrown during storage resolution or query planning. Payload: `namespaceId`, `tableName`.

### ORM.WHERE_MISSING

A Mongo mutation method (e.g. update/delete variants) requires a prior `.where()` filter and none was set. Payload: `method`.

## RUNTIME

### RUNTIME.ABORTED

An in-flight `query()` or `execute()` operation was cancelled via the per-operation `AbortSignal` passed as the call's `{ signal }` option. `details.phase` says where the abort was observed: `encode`, `decode`, `stream`, or the middleware phases `beforeQuery` / `beforeExecute` / `afterQuery` / `afterExecute` / `onRow`; the envelope's `cause` carries `signal.reason` verbatim. Payload: `phase`.

### RUNTIME.AGGREGATE_DESCRIPTOR_INVALID

A component contributed an aggregate descriptor whose shape the SQL aggregate registry cannot read: a missing or empty `operation`, an `input` that is not `none` / `any` / `codec` / `trait` (including an unknown trait name), an `output` that is not `self` / `codec`, a non-boolean `nullable`, a `nullable: false` descriptor with no `emptyResultJson`, a `self` output on an operation that consumes no input, or a non-callable `lower`. `emptyResultJson` is the value a non-nullable operation answers with when no result row reaches the caller, stated in the result codec's canonical JSON: `0` under `pg/int8number@1`, `'0'` under `pg/int8@1`. Raised while the execution context assembles the registry. Payload: `descriptor`.

### RUNTIME.AGGREGATE_LOWERING_MISSING

An aggregate descriptor declares an operation outside the closed SQL aggregate alphabet (`count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`) and carries no `lower` hook. An alphabet operation lowers to a plain aggregate call by default; renderers know no other operation, so any other name must build its expression through a lowering hook from existing AST nodes. Raised while the execution context assembles the aggregate registry. Payload: `operation`, `key`.

### RUNTIME.AGGREGATE_OUTPUT_CODEC_MISSING

An aggregate descriptor names a result codec the composed stack does not register, either its `output` names the codec outright, or a `self` output over an exact input match reuses an input codec the stack never composes. A resolved aggregate decodes its result through the declared codec, so an unregistered one could never decode anything. Raised while the execution context assembles the aggregate registry. Payload: `operation`, `key`, `outputCodecId`.

### RUNTIME.AMBIGUOUS_AGGREGATE_DESCRIPTOR

Two trait-matching aggregate descriptors for one operation both claim a registered codec: the codec advertises both traits, so the result codec is undetermined. Contribute an exact codec descriptor for that operation, or narrow the overlapping trait contributions. Raised while the execution context assembles the aggregate registry, so it never surfaces mid-query. Payload: `operation`, `codecId`, `traits`.

### RUNTIME.ANNOTATION_INAPPLICABLE

A lane terminal (SQL DSL `.build()`, ORM collection terminal) received an annotation whose declared `applicableTo` set does not include the operation kind being built: the runtime check that backs up the type-level annotation validation when it is bypassed via casts or dynamic invocation. Payload: `namespace`, `terminalName`, `kind`, `applicableTo`.

### RUNTIME.ARGUMENT_INVALID

A built-in Postgres query operation or full-text helper received an argument it cannot use, or `postgres()` or `postgresServerless()` received a `cursor` option it cannot use. Three cases: (1) the `language` of `fullTextMatches`, `fullTextRank` and `fullTextHeadline`, of the `tsquery` parsers (`websearchToTsquery`, `toTsquery`, `plaintoTsquery`, `phrasetoTsquery`) and of the `tsquery` template tag is written into the SQL as an inline literal rather than a bound parameter, so it is checked against the text-search configurations a stock PostgreSQL server ships with and anything else is refused, while the query is being built; (2) a literal part of a `tsquery` template has an invalid JavaScript escape, such as `\u`, so JavaScript gives the tag no text for that part and the tag refuses it rather than drop it, also while the query is being built; (3) the `cursor` option has a key other than `batchSize` (including the driver's own `disabled` setting) or a `batchSize` that is not a positive integer, raised at the factory call; leave `cursor` unset to read without a cursor. Payload: `helper` (the operation, or `postgres` / `postgresServerless` for the factory option), `argument`, `received`, plus `extension: 'postgres'` for the factory option.

### RUNTIME.AST_INVALID

A lowered SQL AST is structurally invalid: a subquery projecting other than one column, an INSERT with zero rows, a missing column value, an empty onConflict column list or do-update-set, an UPDATE with no SET assignments, an INSERT target table absent from contract storage, or an AST node constructed with invalid arguments (empty FunctionSource column aliases, a CaseExpr with no branches, a raw query declaring a `__proto__` result column, a name that cannot survive as a column, so alias it in SQL and declare the alias). Raised by the Postgres and SQLite SQL renderers and by AST node construction in relational-core. Payload: `node`, `table`, `column`; construction sites carry node-specific fields.

### RUNTIME.AST_UNSUPPORTED

The authored SQL AST uses a feature this target cannot render, e.g. DEFAULT as a value in INSERT … VALUES, WITH ORDINALITY on function sources, or returned-column aliases on function sources, all on SQLite. Raised by the target adapters' renderers. Payload: `node` (INSERT DEFAULT site); `target`, `feature` (function-source sites).

### RUNTIME.BINDING_INVALID

A client (`postgres()`, `sqlite()`, `mongo()`) received a connection binding whose shape is wrong for the target: malformed connection string, unsupported binding kind, or missing required fields. Raised at `connect(...)` / client construction. A serverless Postgres client raises it from `connect({ url })` for an empty URL, a string that is not a URL, or a scheme other than `postgres://` or `postgresql://`, before any `pg.Client` exists. Payload: `received`, `reason`.

### RUNTIME.BINDING_MISSING

A client (`postgres()`, `sqlite()`, `mongo()`) was asked to connect with no binding at all (no connection string, no environment fallback). Payload: `expected`.

### RUNTIME.CODEC_DESCRIPTOR_ARRAY_UNSUPPORTED

A codec projection used `CodecRef.many` against a SQLite codec descriptor: SQLite has no stored scalar-array codec protocol, so projecting the whole stored array would be ambiguous. Use a scalar CodecRef or an explicit target representation. Payload: `codecId`.

### RUNTIME.CODEC_DESCRIPTOR_INVALID

A codec descriptor handed to a target codec-descriptor registry (Postgres, SQLite) is not a valid descriptor for that target: wrong discriminant, missing target descriptor methods, or a malformed params schema. Extend the target's descriptor class or adapt a generic descriptor with the target's wrapper (`postgresCodec()` / `sqliteCodec()`). Payload: `codecId`.

### RUNTIME.CODEC_DESCRIPTOR_MISSING

A column (or AST-carried CodecRef) references a `codecId` for which no runtime component registered a codec descriptor: usually the extension pack that owns the codec is missing from the runtime stack. Surfaces at SQL context construction during the contract codec walk, or lazily when the AST codec resolver materializes a codec at query time. Payload: `codecId`; on the column path also `table`, `column`.

### RUNTIME.CODEC_MISSING

Runtime validation of the contract found columns whose `codecId` has no implementation in the codec registry; the error lists every affected column. Surfaces when the codec registry's completeness is validated at context/runtime setup. Payload: `contractTarget`, `invalidCodecs` (list of `{ namespaceId, table, column, codecId }`).

### RUNTIME.CODEC_PARAMETERIZATION_MISMATCH

A column's codec reference disagrees with the codec's parameterization: a parameterized codec is used with no `typeParams` (and its schema requires some), or `typeParams` are supplied to a non-parameterized codec. Surfaces during the SQL context's contract codec walk. Payload: `table`, `column`, `codecId`, `expected`, `actual`.

### RUNTIME.CONTENT_HASH_REQUIRES_RESOLVED_COMMAND

Mongo middleware called `ctx.contentHash(plan)` (or `computeMongoContentHash`) during `beforeExecute`, when `plan.command` is still an unresolved lowered draft rather than a resolved wire command. Compute the hash from `afterExecute`, or use the param mutator instead of reading `plan.command` structurally. Payload: `phase`.

### RUNTIME.CONTRACT_FAMILY_MISMATCH

At SQL context construction, the contract's target family (e.g. `mongo`) does not match the runtime stack's family (`sql`): the contract was emitted for a different database family than the stack being assembled. Payload: `actual`, `expected`.

### RUNTIME.CONTRACT_TARGET_MISMATCH

At SQL context construction, the contract's target (e.g. `sqlite`) does not match the runtime stack's target descriptor (e.g. `postgres`): the contract and the adapter/driver stack disagree about the database target. Payload: `actual`, `expected`.

### RUNTIME.DDL_UNSUPPORTED

`lower()` was asked to lower DDL on a surface that cannot do it: the runtime adapter (DDL lowering is a control-plane concern), or the synchronous control lowering path (DDL default literals require async codec encoding; use `lowerToExecuteRequest()`). Raised by the Postgres and SQLite adapters. Payload: `surface`.

### RUNTIME.DECODE_FAILED

A codec's `decode` threw while converting a wire value into its output type during result decoding, surfaces per column (SQL), per document field (Mongo), or per included-relation column (ORM client), with the original error attached as `cause`. Also thrown when a returned row is missing an expected projection alias, or when the JSON array for an include alias fails to parse. Payload: `table`, `column` (or `alias` / `collection` + `path`), `codec`, `wirePreview`. When a Mongo codec raised the code itself, its own details (for the target's codecs, `codecId` and `received`) are kept alongside. An `InternalError` from a codec is a bug in Prisma, not a bad stored value, so it is not wrapped and surfaces unchanged. On Mongo the message also names the document it read, `Failed to decode field <path> of the document with _id <id> in collection '<collection>' …`, with the id (an `ObjectId` as hex, a string quoted) in `documentId`; for a document an insert returns, `<path>` starts at that document and the id is its `_id`; `wirePreview` is the JSON text of the stored value, each BSON class in its own JSON form, cut at 100 characters.

Codecs also raise this code directly, as a structured envelope with `meta.codecId` and `meta.received`. The integer guards: `pg/int8number@1` and `sqlite/bigintnumber@1` (the `BigIntNumber` type), and `mongo/int64Number@1` (the `Int64Number` type), refuse a stored value outside the safe integer range ±(2^53 − 1) and any non-integral value rather than rounding it; on a stored fractional double, `mongo/int64@1` and `mongo/int64Number@1` say how to rewrite it as a long; `pg/int8@1`, `pg/unboundedint@1`, and `sqlite/bigint@1` refuse a wire or JSON value that is not a decimal integer. Every built-in codec's `decodeJson` follows the rule on [`Codec.decodeJson`](../../packages/1-framework/1-core/framework-components/src/shared/codec.ts): it refuses a JSON value that is not a stored form of its type, including one its type parameters rule out, with the message `<codecId> JSON value must be <what it takes>` and `meta.received`, the value as JSON text cut to 100 characters, as in `pg/text@1 JSON value must be a string`, `pg/int4@1 JSON value must be an integer from -2147483648 to 2147483647`, or `sql/varchar@1 JSON value must be a string of at most 3 characters`. Each accepts every form PostgreSQL or SQLite writes for the type in JSON. A float codec's `decodeJson` takes a finite number or the text `NaN`, `Infinity` or `-Infinity`, which PostgreSQL writes for those values. On SQLite, `sqlite/real@1` and `sql/float@1` refuse `NaN`, which SQLite stores as NULL: their `decodeJson` raises this code for the text `"NaN"`, and their `encode` and `encodeJson` raise `RUNTIME.ENCODE_FAILED`, so a `.default(NaN)` fails when the contract is built. The Mongo codecs' `decodeJson` refuses a JSON value of another kind the same way, as in `mongo/int32@1 JSON value must be an integer from -2147483648 to 2147483647`. In both families, the PSL reader reads each `enum` member with the enum's codec: a member the codec refuses is reported as `PSL_EXTENSION_INVALID_VALUE`, with the codec's message, or `PSL_ENUM_BARE_MEMBER_NON_STRING_CODEC` for a member written without a value under a codec that does not take text. On a flat read the codec's envelope surfaces unchanged; on an `.include()` read the ORM client wraps it in a fresh `RUNTIME.DECODE_FAILED` carrying `table`, `column`, and `codec`, with the codec's envelope on `cause`. One SQLite caveat: on a flat read, `node:sqlite` itself refuses an INTEGER outside the safe range before any codec runs, so for an out-of-band stored value the structured envelope is guaranteed on the include/JSON path, not the flat path.

On Mongo, `mongo/json@1` (a `Json` field) raises this code when the stored value is not JSON at some depth: `mongo/json@1 wire value contains a non-JSON BSON <type> at <path>`, where `<type>` is the BSON `$type` alias (`date`, `objectId`, `decimal`, `binData`, `regex`, `timestamp`, `long` for one outside the safe-integer range, `undefined`, `symbol`, `javascript`, `minKey`, `maxKey`, or the constructor name of an object the driver does not produce) and `<path>` is the dot-notation path inside the field, with array indices as segments, or `the root`. A stored `NaN`, `Infinity` or `-Infinity` is named as such: `mongo/json@1 wire value contains NaN at <path>; a JSON number cannot be NaN or Infinity`, with `meta.received` set to that value. A subdocument with `$ref` and `$id`, which the driver reads as a `DBRef`, decodes back to the document it was stored as, each member checked at its own path (`link.$id`). A stored subdocument that merely has a `_bsontype` key is read as that document, not as the type it names. The codec's envelope carries `meta.codecId`, `meta.received` (the BSON type) and `meta.valuePath` (the path inside the field); the runtime's wrapper copies them into its `details` beside `collection` and `path`, the field's own path in the document. A `long` in the safe-integer range and the driver's `Int32` and `Double` wrappers decode as numbers. Such a field should be `Bson`, which admits any BSON value.

**Aggregates reach the same guards.** `count()` and `sum()` over integers declare a number-flavoured result codec, so a tally or total past ±(2^53 − 1) raises this code: `pg/int8number@1 value must be an integer within the safe integer range, got 9007199254740992`, instead of returning a rounded value. It fires on the wire path and on the `.include()` path alike: the include projection is a JSON number, but the guard runs after `JSON.parse`, and rounding is monotone, so a value that was outside the range is still outside it. Where the magnitude is real rather than a bug, switch that call to the lossless variant beside it: `countBigInt()`, `sumBigInt()`, or `avgDecimal()`.

### RUNTIME.DUPLICATE_AGGREGATE_DESCRIPTOR

Two components claim the same aggregate overload: the same `(operation, input)` pair, keyed as `sum:trait:numeric`, `sum:codec:pg/int8@1`, or `count:none`. Each overload resolves to exactly one result codec, so exactly one target, adapter, or extension may contribute it. Payload: `key`.

### RUNTIME.DUPLICATE_AUTHORING_DISCRIMINATOR

Two authoring contributions register the same discriminator key, the same `entityType` key or the same `pslBlock` parser keyword, when the framework authoring surface assembles its descriptor registry. Each contribution must use a unique key. Payload: `label`, `key`, `existingPath`, `path`.

### RUNTIME.DUPLICATE_CODEC

Two runtime stack contributors (target pack, extension packs) register a codec with the same id, while the SQL context or Mongo execution stack collects codecs, or while a target codec-descriptor registry (Postgres, SQLite) is composed. Remove the duplicate contribution. Payload: `codecId`; on the Mongo path also `existingOwner`, `incomingOwner`; on the target registry path also `target`.

### RUNTIME.DUPLICATE_MUTATION_DEFAULT_GENERATOR

Two runtime stack contributors register a mutation default generator with the same id while the SQL context or the Mongo execution context collects them. Payload: `id`, `existingOwner`, `incomingOwner`.

### RUNTIME.ENCODE_FAILED

A codec's `encode` threw while converting a user-supplied parameter value to driver wire format during query execution (SQL param encoding, or Mongo param-ref resolution), with the original error attached as `cause`. Payload: `label`, `codec`; SQL path also `paramIndex`. On Mongo, a value written through the ORM is labelled with its field path, the payload adds `collection`, and the message reads `Failed to encode field <path> in collection '<collection>' with codec '<id>': …`. When a Mongo codec raised the code itself, its own details (for the target's codecs, `codecId` and `received`) are kept alongside. An `InternalError` from a codec is a bug in Prisma, not a bad value, so it is not wrapped and surfaces unchanged.

Codecs also raise this code directly, as a structured envelope with `meta.codecId` and `meta.received`, which surfaces unchanged: writing a value outside ±(2^53 − 1), or a non-integral number, through `pg/int8number@1` or `sqlite/bigintnumber@1` (the `BigIntNumber` type) raises it before any SQL executes, and through `mongo/int64Number@1` (the `Int64Number` type) before any command is sent.

On SQLite, which cannot store NaN and binds it as NULL, NaN raises this code. `sqlite/real@1` and `sql/float@1` refuse it in `encode`, for a value written to a column or used as a filter value, and in `encodeJson`, for a TypeScript `.default()`: `<codecId> value must be a number other than NaN, which SQLite cannot store`. The SQLite driver refuses a NaN parameter no codec encoded, such as one in raw SQL: `Parameter <n> is NaN, which SQLite cannot store: it would bind it as NULL. Pass null to store no value.` Both carry `meta.received: 'NaN'`; `meta.codecId` is present when a codec refused the value, and `meta.paramIndex`, counted from 0, when the driver did. Pass `null` for no value.

On Mongo, `mongo/json@1` (a `Json` field) raises this code for any value that is not a plain JSON value at some depth: `mongo/json@1 value must be a JSON value; received <kind> at <path>`. `<kind>` is the `_bsontype` tag of a BSON value (`ObjectId`, `Long`, `Decimal128`, `Binary`, …), `Date`, `bigint`, `symbol`, `function`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, `sparse array hole`, `circular reference`, or the constructor name of any other non-plain object (`Map`, `Uint8Array`, a class name); `<path>` is the dot-notation path inside the value, or `the root`. The message ends with how to store the value instead, worded for its kind: a `Date` as an ISO 8601 string, a `bigint` or `Long` as a safe-integer number or decimal text, an `ObjectId` as its hex string, bytes as base64 text, or, for any BSON value, by declaring the field `Bson`. The codec's envelope carries `meta.codecId`, `meta.received` (the kind) and `meta.valuePath` (the path inside the value); the runtime's wrapper copies them into its `details` beside `label`, `collection` and `codec`. `mongo/bson@1` (a `Bson` field) raises the same shape, `mongo/bson@1 value must be a BSON value; received <kind> at <path>`, for `undefined`, `bigint`, `symbol`, a function, a `DBRef` instance (the message ends `Write it as a { $ref, $id } document instead.`), a sparse-array hole, a circular reference, an object carrying a `_bsontype` the driver's `bson` did not create (`<tag> not created by bson 7`: a literal look-alike such as `{ _bsontype: 'MinKey' }`, or a value from another major version of `bson`), or a non-plain object other than a `Date`, native `RegExp` or `Uint8Array` (`Map`, `Set`, a class instance, another typed array).

The Mongo codecs refuse a value of the wrong type with this code, a list element included, so it is not stored: `mongo/string@1 value must be a string; received <value>`, and the same for `mongo/bool@1` (a boolean), `mongo/date@1` (a valid Date; an invalid `Date` would be stored as the epoch), `mongo/objectId@1` (a 24-digit hex string or an ObjectId; `null` would otherwise become a new id and a number a timestamp), `mongo/vector@1` (an array of numbers), `mongo/int32@1`, `mongo/int64Number@1` (an integer from -9007199254740991 to 9007199254740991) and `mongo/double@1`. `<value>` is a number, a `bigint` written with its `n` suffix (`9n`), a quoted string, `null`, `an array`, `a Date`, `an invalid Date`, or the value's JavaScript type; for an object tagged as an `ObjectId` whose `toHexString()` is missing or does not return 24 hex digits, it is `an object tagged ObjectId whose toHexString() does not return 24 hex digits`. An `ObjectId` from any major version of `bson` is accepted and rebuilt from its hex string.

The Mongo ORM also raises this code, before anything reaches the driver, for two values that a contract without a collection validator (built with the TypeScript builder, or read from a Prisma 6 schema) would store. Both apply to values written by `create`, `update` and `upsert`; a filter may compare a field with either, to find documents that already hold one.

- A value outside a field's enum: `Failed to encode field <path> in collection '<collection>': "<value>" is not a value of enum <Enum>; the values are "<a>" and "<b>"`, with `label`, `collection`, `received` and `allowed` in `details`.
- `null` for a field that is not nullable: `Failed to encode field <path> in collection '<collection>': the field is required and cannot be null`, with `label` and `collection` in `details`. `null` for a nullable field is written as `null` without calling the field's codec.

The SQL integer codecs also check the JS type of the value they are given, and report that separately from the range: `pg/int8number@1` and `sqlite/bigintnumber@1` read a `number`, while `pg/int8@1`, `pg/unboundedint@1`, and `sqlite/bigint@1` read a `bigint`. A value of the other type raises `<codec> value must be a <number|bigint>, got <type> <value>` with `meta.received` naming the type that arrived: the message you get from passing `9n` where a `number` is read, rather than a range complaint about a value plainly inside the range. `mongo/int64Number@1` reports both in one message, as the other Mongo codecs do, and the suffix shows the type: `value must be an integer from -9007199254740991 to 9007199254740991; received 9n`.

The exact integer codecs make one exception, and only on the JSON side. `encodeJson` on `pg/int8@1`, `pg/unboundedint@1`, and `sqlite/bigint@1` also accepts a `number`, because a schema language writes no `bigint` literal. The number must be an integer within the safe range, and a value that is not raises `<codec> number literal must be an integer within the safe integer range, got <value>`: a `number` past that range was already rounded before the codec saw it, so its digits no longer name the value that was written. The PSL interpreter therefore does not hand these codecs a rounded number: it reads a number `@default` from its source text, gives the codec the plain number when that decodes, and the decimal text of the literal when it does not, so `BigInt @default(0)` still arrives as the JSON number `0` while `BigInt @default(9007199254739999999)` arrives as its digits. `encode`, the wire path a query parameter travels, takes no such number; it requires the `bigint`.

### RUNTIME.EXECUTION_RESULT_MISSING

A statistics execution completed without returning statement statistics. This indicates a runtime or middleware implementation violated the execution contract instead of returning `{ affectedRows }`. Payload: none.

### RUNTIME.ITERATOR_CONSUMED

An `AsyncIterableResult` (the return value of `query()`) was iterated a second time: each result can be consumed only once, whether via a `for await` loop or via `toArray()`/`await`. Store the array from `toArray()` if you need to reuse the rows. Payload: `consumedBy`, `suggestion`.

### RUNTIME.JSON_SCHEMA_VALIDATION_FAILED

The `arktype-json` codec rejected a JSON value that does not satisfy the column's arktype schema, on encode (writing) or decode (reading). Also thrown when the schema itself cannot be rehydrated from the contract's stored JSON IR. Payload: `codecId`, `issues` (validation) or `jsonIr` (rehydration).

### RUNTIME.MIDDLEWARE_FAMILY_MISMATCH

A middleware registered on the runtime declares a `familyId` (e.g. `sql`) that differs from the runtime's family, e.g. a SQL-only middleware added to a Mongo runtime. Checked when the runtime validates its middleware list. Payload: `middleware`, `middlewareFamilyId`, `runtimeFamilyId`.

### RUNTIME.MIDDLEWARE_INCOMPATIBLE

A middleware declares a `targetId` without also declaring a `familyId`, an invalid combination, since target scoping only makes sense within a family. Checked when the runtime validates its middleware list. Payload: `middleware`, `targetId`.

### RUNTIME.MIDDLEWARE_RESULT_MISMATCH

Middleware returned a query result for a statistics operation, or statistics for a row query. Middleware interception results must carry the same `operation` discriminant as the operation they intercept. Payload: `expected`, `received`.

### RUNTIME.MIDDLEWARE_TARGET_MISMATCH

A middleware declares a `targetId` (e.g. `postgres`) that differs from the runtime's configured target. Checked when the runtime validates its middleware list. Payload: `middleware`, `middlewareTargetId`, `runtimeTargetId`.

### RUNTIME.MISSING_EXTENSION_PACK

At SQL context construction, the contract requires one or more extension packs that no component in the runtime stack provides. Add the missing pack(s) to the stack. Payload: `packIds`.

### RUNTIME.MONGO_STATISTICS_RESULT_INVALID

A Mongo update or delete command did not return exactly one result object with the required numeric native count field. Updates require `modifiedCount`; deletes require `deletedCount`. Payload: `commandKind`, `countField`.

### RUNTIME.MONGO_STATISTICS_UNSUPPORTED

Statistics execution was requested for a Mongo command that does not expose affected-row statistics. Only update and delete command kinds provide the native counts used by this operation. Payload: `commandKind`.

### RUNTIME.MUTATION_DEFAULT_GENERATOR_MISSING

The contract declares column or field defaults produced by a mutation default generator (e.g. a nanoid/uuid generator, or `timestampNow` behind `temporal.createdAt()`) that no runtime component provides, detected up front when the SQL context or the Mongo execution context validates generator coverage, or at mutation time when a generator-kind default spec is resolved. The message names each missing generator with the `<collection or table>.<field>` entries that need it, and says where generators come from: the built-in ones, `timestampNow` among them, from the database adapter's runtime descriptor, others from the extension pack that defines them. Payload: `ids` and `fields` (validation pass) or `id` (resolution).

### RUNTIME.NAMESPACE_UNKNOWN

At query-render time a table references a namespace that is not present, or not materialised as a database schema, on the contract. Raised by the Postgres and SQLite SQL renderers. Payload: `table`, `namespaceId`, `reason`.

### RUNTIME.NO_ROWS

`firstOrThrow()` was called on a query result that returned no rows. Use `first()` if an empty result is acceptable.

### RUNTIME.PARAM_REF_CODEC_REQUIRED

While building a query expression, a plain JS value was passed where no codec could be derived: `toExpr` cannot construct a ParamRef for a bare value without an explicit `CodecRef`. Provide a codec at the call site or use a column-bound builder path.

### RUNTIME.PARAM_REF_MISSING_CODEC

The Postgres SQL renderer reached lowering with a ParamRef that carries no bound `CodecRef`, an internal invariant of the AST-bound codec contract, usually indicating a builder path that constructed a ParamRef without threading the column codec. Payload: `paramIndex`, `name`.

### RUNTIME.PREPARE_BIND_ON_ADHOC

An AST containing a prepared-statement bind-site reference (`PreparedParamRef`) was submitted to the ad-hoc `execute()` path. Bind-site references are only valid inside `runtime.prepare(...)`. Payload: `name`.

### RUNTIME.PREPARE_MISSING_PARAM

Executing a prepared statement without supplying a value for one of its declared parameters: the lookup fails rather than silently binding `undefined`. Payload: `name`.

### RUNTIME.PREPARE_UNUSED_PARAM

`runtime.prepare(declaration, callback)` found declared parameter names that the callback's plan never references. Remove the unused declarations or reference them in the plan. Payload: `unused`.

### RUNTIME.RAW_ROW_COLUMN_MISSING

A whole-query raw statement returned a result that omits a column its row spec declares. The runtime never parses the SQL, so the spec is its only description of the result: a column the spec names and the statement does not return is a mismatch the caller has to resolve, by correcting the spec or the statement. Distinct from `RUNTIME.DECODE_FAILED`, which means a codec rejected a value the runtime did expect. Surplus result columns the spec does not declare are dropped silently and never raise this. See [ADR 247](../architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20247%20-%20Whole-query%20raw%20SQL%20is%20the%20fragment%20mechanism%20at%20statement%20position.md). Payload: `column`, `declaredColumns`, `resultColumns`.

### RUNTIME.RAW_SQL_UNSUPPORTED_INTERPOLATION

A raw-SQL tagged template interpolated a JS value whose type cannot be auto-inferred to a codec (anything other than number, bigint, string, boolean, or Uint8Array). Wrap the value in `param(...)` with an explicit codec.

### RUNTIME.TEMPORAL_UNAVAILABLE

A value that only a `Temporal` implementation can produce or read was needed in a process that has neither a global `Temporal` nor the fallback `Temporal` of the Postgres target. Two paths raise it, and they carry different metadata:

- A Temporal-backed codec (`pg/date-temporal@1`, `pg/timestamp-temporal@1`, `pg/timestamptz-temporal@1`, `pg/time-temporal@1`) decoding a value. Payload: `codecId`, `operation` (`'decode'`). Encoding a `Temporal` value needs no implementation and does not raise this error.
- The `instantNow` or `plainDateTimeNow` mutation-default generator producing a value, for `temporal.createdAt()`, `temporal.updatedAt()`, or for a `temporal.timestamptz(…)` / `timestamp(…)` preset given an `onCreate`/`onUpdate` of `'now'`. No codec is involved. Payload: `generatorId`.

The check is lazy: registering the target, validating a contract, building a runtime, resolving a descriptor and constructing a codec instance all succeed without `Temporal`. Only producing or interpreting a value fails.

It is raised on **reads**, because the check is the first thing a Temporal codec does on decode: selecting the column is enough. And it is raised on an **insert into a table carrying `temporal.updatedAt()`**, because that column's clock produces a `Temporal.Instant` even when your code never mentions a temporal value; that path reports `generatorId` rather than `codecId`, since no codec has been reached yet.

This error never occurs in the control plane. The CLI commands, `node migration.ts`, the Vite plugin, the language server and the programmatic control client all load `prisma.config.ts` or the control descriptors, and so load the target's control entry. The target's control entry (`@internal/target-postgres/control`) sets the fallback `Temporal`, from `temporal-polyfill`, when it is loaded. It does not set `globalThis.Temporal`. `temporal-polyfill` is a required peer dependency of `@prisma/orm-postgres` and `@prisma/orm-target-postgres`. npm, pnpm and bun install it automatically; a project that uses Yarn adds it to its own dependencies. When it is not installed, loading the control entry fails because Node.js cannot find the package `temporal-polyfill`, not with this error. The fallback is held once per process, and every Postgres codec in the process uses it. An application process that loads no control-plane code and has no global `Temporal` gets `RUNTIME.TEMPORAL_UNAVAILABLE`. An application that loads control-plane code in its own process, such as server code under `vite dev` with the Prisma Vite plugin or a script that calls the control client, decodes dates without its own `Temporal`, and then fails in production. An application that uses the Temporal codecs must load its own `Temporal`.

In the application, install a global implementation before any query runs (`import 'temporal-polyfill/full/global'`), or author the column with its `*String` type (`DateString`, `TimestampString(p)`, `TimestamptzString(p)`, `TimeString(p)`) to read and write PostgreSQL's own text, which needs no Temporal at all.

### RUNTIME.TRANSACTION_CLOSED

A query result created inside a transaction was read after the transaction ended. Await the result or call `.toArray()` inside the transaction callback.

### RUNTIME.TRANSACTION_COMMIT_FAILED

Committing a transaction failed; the runtime attempts a cleanup rollback and destroys the connection if that also fails. The driver's commit error is attached as `cause`. Payload: `commitError`.

### RUNTIME.TRANSACTION_ROLLBACK_FAILED

Rolling back a transaction after the callback threw itself failed; the connection is destroyed rather than returned to the pool. The original callback error is attached as `cause`. Payload: `rollbackError`.

### RUNTIME.TYPE_PARAMS_INVALID

A parameterized codec's `paramsSchema` rejected the `typeParams` carried by a codec reference (or the schema returned a Promise; runtime validation requires a synchronous Standard Schema validator). The `arktype-json` codec also throws it when the contract's serialized schema expression does not match the rehydrated schema, indicating a stale or hand-edited contract. Payload: `codecId`, `typeParams` (plus `table`/`column` or `typeName` on the contract-walk path).

## DRIVER

### DRIVER.ALREADY_CONNECTED

Calling `connect(binding)` on a driver, or `connect()` on a client (`postgres()`, `sqlite()`, `mongo()`) or the CLI control client, when it is already connected. Close with `close()` before reconnecting with a new binding. Payload: `bindingKind`.

### DRIVER.CONNECTION_FAILED

A control-plane driver could not establish a database connection (`driver.create(url)` in the SQLite, Postgres, and Mongo control drivers), or `connect({ url })` on a serverless Postgres client (`@prisma/orm-postgres/serverless`) could not open its `pg.Client`'s database connection: the database refused the connection, rejected the credentials, or did not answer within the 20 second connect timeout. The `why` carries the underlying driver message and the original error is attached as `cause`; connection URLs in meta are redacted. Payload: `path` (SQLite); `sqlState` plus redacted URL fields (Postgres control driver); redacted URL fields (Mongo); `extension: 'postgres'` plus redacted URL fields (serverless `connect`).

### DRIVER.NOT_CONNECTED

Using a driver, a client, or the CLI control client before `connect(...)` has been called, or after it was closed. It surfaces from runtime `query` / `execute`, a prepared statement's `query(target, params, options?)`, `acquireConnection`, or `explain`, including lazily when iterating a query result. A closed Postgres client or serverless connection raises it from `runtime()`, `transaction(...)` and `prepare(...)`, which throw it synchronously, and from ORM queries, which reject with it.

### DRIVER.PREPARE_FAILED

A prepared statement failed again after the PostgreSQL driver discarded a stale handle and retried with a fresh handle. The normalized PostgreSQL error is attached as `cause`. Payload: `handle`.

## MIGRATION

### MIGRATION.AMBIGUOUS_MIGRATION_REF

A migration reference (directory name or hash prefix) passed to a CLI command matches migrations in more than one contract space, so the command cannot tell which one you mean. Re-run with `--space <id>` to pick a space. Payload: `ref`, `spaceIds`.

### MIGRATION.BUNDLE_NOT_FOUND_FOR_GRAPH_NODE

A hash resolves to a node in the migration graph, but no on-disk migration package has that hash as its destination (`to`), so there is no bundle to read for it. Hit when resolving a ref or hash to a migration bundle (e.g. `migration show`, contract-at resolution). Payload: `hash`, `explicitLabel` (when the user supplied a named reference).

### MIGRATION.CHECK_CONTRACT_UNREADABLE

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: the `contract.json` for a contract space cannot be read or validated. Re-emit the extension contract artifacts or fix the descriptor producing the invalid contract.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_DANGLING_REF

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: a ref file points at a contract hash that does not exist in the space's migration graph. Update the ref with `prisma migration ref set <name> <valid-hash>` or delete it.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_DECLARED_BUT_UNMIGRATED

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: an extension is declared in `extensions` but has no on-disk migrations directory under `migrations/`. Re-emit the extension's contract-space artifacts, or remove the extension from `extensions`.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_DUPLICATE_MIGRATION_HASH

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: multiple migration packages in the same contract space share the same `migrationHash`, so the packages are not uniquely content-addressed. Re-emit one of the conflicting packages.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_FILE_MISSING

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: a required file (`migration.json` or `ops.json`) is missing from a migration package directory. Re-emit the package or restore it from version control.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_HASH_MISMATCH

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: the `migrationHash` stored in `migration.json` does not match the hash recomputed from the package contents: the package was edited or partially written since emit. Re-emit the package or restore it from version control.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_HEAD_REF_MISSING

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: a contract space has no `refs/head.json`. Re-emit the contract-space migrations and head-ref artifacts, or restore the file from version control.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_HEAD_REF_NOT_IN_GRAPH

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: the hash in a space's `refs/head.json` is not a node in that space's migration graph. Re-emit the space's migrations or restore the missing migration package.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_NOOP_SELF_EDGE

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: a migration has identical source and target hashes and declares no data invariant, a true no-op self-edge. Add a data operation if it was meant to carry one, or delete the migration.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_ORPHAN_SPACE_DIR

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: a contract-space directory exists under `migrations/` but no declared extension claims it. Remove the directory or declare the extension in `extensions`.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_PACKAGE_UNLOADABLE

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: a migration package directory exists but could not be loaded (parse or validation failure); the row's detail names the underlying cause. Re-emit the package or restore it from version control.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_PROVIDED_INVARIANTS_MISMATCH

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: the `providedInvariants` list stored in `migration.json` disagrees with the one derived from `ops.json`. Re-emit the package so the two files agree.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_REF_UNREADABLE

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: a ref file in a space's `refs/` directory cannot be read or parsed. Repair or remove the corrupt ref file.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_SNAPSHOT_CONTENT_MISMATCH

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: a contract snapshot's declared `storage.storageHash` agrees with the migration's `to` hash, but the snapshot's content recomputes to a different storage hash — the file under `migrations/snapshots/<hash>/` has been edited (or corrupted) since it was written. Restore `migrations/snapshots/` from version control, or re-run the command that produced the migration to regenerate its snapshot.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_SNAPSHOT_HASH_MISMATCH

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: a migration declares a destination hash `to` but the contract snapshot stored for that hash has a different inner `storage.storageHash`. Re-emit the package so `migration.json` and its snapshot agree.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_SNAPSHOT_UNPARSEABLE

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: either the migration's `to` value is not a well-formed 64-hex hash, or the contract snapshot stored for it exists but cannot be parsed. Re-emit the package, or restore `migrations/snapshots/` from version control.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_SPACE_DISJOINTNESS_VIOLATION

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: a storage element (table/collection) is claimed by more than one contract space. Update the contracts so each storage element is owned by exactly one space.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_TARGET_MISMATCH

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: a contract space's declared database target differs from the project's configured target. Update the extension to target the configured database, or change the project target.

### MIGRATION.CHECK_UNREACHABLE_MIGRATION

A `migration check` finding, carried as an `error` diagnostic on a completed run that exits `4`: a migration's `from` hash is not produced by any other migration (and is not the empty state), so the migration is unreachable in the graph. Delete it or re-emit a connecting migration.

### MIGRATION.CONSENT_PLAN_MISMATCH

An apply carrying consent was refused because the plan recomputed for it is not the plan that was consented to. `db update` recomputes the plan at apply time and compares its hash against the one the consent was given for; a mismatch means the schema, the contract, or the database moved in between, so applying would carry out operations nobody agreed to. Re-run the command and review the freshly planned operations before consenting again. Payload: `consentedPlanHash`, `planHash`.

### MIGRATION.CONTRACT_DESERIALIZATION_FAILED

A contract JSON on disk failed to deserialize into a valid contract: either a snapshot-store entry read while migration tooling resolved a contract at a ref or hash, or the emitted `contract.json` read as the fallback source by `db sign` / `db update --to` (invalid JSON, or a value that is not a JSON object). Re-emit the owning migration package (or re-run `prisma contract emit` for the emitted contract), or restore the file from version control. Payload: `filePath`, `message`. Also raised by `migration new` when the emitted `contract.json` fails to deserialize; that site has no meta and attaches the deserialization failure as `cause`.

### MIGRATION.CONTRACT_SNAPSHOT_CONTENT_MISMATCH

A contract snapshot loaded from `migrations/snapshots/<hash>/contract.json` does not reproduce the storage hash it is addressed by: the store is content-addressed, and the file has been edited (or corrupted) since it was written. Raised at the snapshot-store load seam, so every command that resolves a contract from the store (`migration plan`, `migration ref set`, `db sign` / `db update --to`, aggregate contract resolution) refuses instead of treating the edited content as the recorded contract. The envelope names the file and both hashes (meta: `storageHash`, `computedHash`, `jsonPath`). Restore `migrations/snapshots/` from version control, or re-run the command that authored the referencing migration to regenerate the snapshot.

### MIGRATION.CONTRACT_SNAPSHOT_HASH_MISMATCH

While writing a contract snapshot, the contract JSON's inner `storage.storageHash` does not equal the storage hash the snapshot is being filed under: the two must agree by construction. Primarily an authoring/tooling invariant rather than something a user causes directly. Payload: `storageHash`, `actualHash`, `dir`.

### MIGRATION.CONTRACT_SNAPSHOT_MISSING

A contract snapshot expected under `migrations/snapshots/` for a given storage hash does not exist on disk, so commands that need the contract at that hash (`migration plan`, `ref`-based resolution, `migration check`) cannot proceed. Re-run the command that authored the referencing migration to regenerate the snapshot, or restore `migrations/snapshots/` from version control. Payload: `storageHash`, `expectedPath`.

### MIGRATION.CONTRACT_SPACE_LAYOUT_VIOLATION

The on-disk `migrations/` directory and the `extensions` declaration in config disagree: an orphan space directory exists with no declaring extension, or a declared extension has no migrations directory. All layout offences are bundled into one envelope. Raised when db commands load the contract-space aggregate. Payload: `violations` (list of `{kind, spaceId}`).

### MIGRATION.CONTRACT_SPACE_VIOLATION

A contract-space check raised under one code, in two lanes with different exits. As an error at exit `2` when the check could not run: a space's target mismatches the project target, two spaces claim the same storage element, a space contract is unreadable, or aggregate introspection failed (`db verify`, `db init`, `db update`). As an `error`-severity diagnostic on a completed `db verify` run that exits `4`, including under `--marker-only`, when the check ran and found per-space marker drift: a marker hash mismatch, missing invariants, or an orphan marker row, reported next to the single-contract marker findings that already settle there. The envelope's `why` lists the specific violations. Payload: `violations`.

### MIGRATION.CONTRACT_VIEW_MISSING

A migration object's `endContract`/`startContract` accessor was read, but the instance carries no `endContractJson`/`startContractJson` to build the contract view from, typically a migration that overrides `describe()` and carries no contract. Payload: `className`, `accessor`, `jsonField`.

### MIGRATION.DATA_TRANSFORM_CONTRACT_MISMATCH

At migration authoring/emit time, a `dataTransform(endContract, …)` produced a query plan whose storage hash does not match the contract passed to `dataTransform`: the query builder was configured with a different contract reference than the migration itself. Make both use the same imported `endContract`. Payload: `dataTransformName`, `expected`, `actual`.

### MIGRATION.DESCRIBE_INVALID

A migration author class's `describe()` result is unusable: it carries neither an `endContractJson` nor an override, or the returned metadata fails validation. Raised while loading/describing an authored migration. Payload: `reason`.

### MIGRATION.DESCRIPTOR_HEAD_HASH_MISMATCH

An extension descriptor publishes a `contractSpace` whose `headRef.hash` does not match the hash recomputed from its `contractJson`: the descriptor was published with a stale head hash, typically because the contract was bumped without rerunning the extension's emit pipeline. Payload: `extensionId`, `recomputedHash`, `headRefHash`.

### MIGRATION.DESTINATION_CONTRACT_MISMATCH

Runner-level failure during apply (`db init`, `db update`, `db migrate`): the plan's destination storage hash (or profile hash) does not match the destination contract handed to the runner alongside it. Indicates the plan and contract came from different emits. Payload: `planStorageHash`/`contractStorageHash` (or `planProfileHash`/`contractProfileHash`).

### MIGRATION.DESTRUCTIVE_CHANGES

The planned operations include destructive changes (e.g. DROP) and the command was run without explicit consent. `db update` asks for that consent instead of failing: interactively it asks you to type the name of the database it is about to change, and outside an interactive terminal it is granted by `--confirm <database>` (`--yes` accepts declared prompt defaults and never grants consent; `--confirm` is read only when the run is non-interactive or `--yes` is set, so a script run from a terminal needs `--no-interactive --confirm <database>`). The name is the `database` a driver connection object carries, or the connection URL's first path segment, else its host, falling back to the target id. A run with nobody to ask and no `--confirm` settles as `CLI.CONSENT_REQUIRED` at exit 2; a run whose prompt is cancelled settles as `CLI.PROMPT_CANCELLED` at exit 3. `--dry-run` never asks; it settles as this error instead. Use it to preview the operations first. `migration plan` raises the same refusal before writing an auto-baseline package (planned on an empty migrations directory from the `db` ref) whose operations would remove data when applied; there the consent token is the project directory name, so a non-interactive run passes `--no-interactive --confirm <directory>`, and a consented re-run that no longer plans the consented baseline settles as `MIGRATION.CONSENT_PLAN_MISMATCH`. Payload at the `migration plan` site: `destructiveOperations`, `planHash`.

### MIGRATION.DIR_EXISTS

`migration new`/`migration plan` refused to scaffold because the target migration directory already exists: each migration needs a unique directory. Pick a different `--name` or delete the existing directory. Payload: `dir`.

### MIGRATION.DUPLICATE_INVARIANT_IN_EDGE

Two `dataTransform` operations on the same migration declare the same `invariantId`. Invariants are stored per-migration as a set, so two operations cannot share a routing identity; rename one, or drop the `invariantId` on the operation that need not be routing-visible. Payload: `invariantId`.

### MIGRATION.DUPLICATE_MIGRATION_HASH

While reconstructing the migration graph, two migrations were found sharing the same `migrationHash`; each migration must have a unique content-addressed identity. Regenerate one of the conflicting migrations. Payload: `migrationHash`.

### MIGRATION.DUPLICATE_SPACE_ID

The per-space migration planner received the same contract-space id more than once, usually a repeated entry in `extensions`. Deduplicate the inputs. Payload: `spaceId`.

### MIGRATION.EXECUTION_FAILED

A migration operation's SQL step failed while being executed against the database during apply (`db init`, `db update`, `db migrate`). The envelope carries the database error detail so you can see which statement failed and why. Payload: `operationId`, `stepDescription`, `sql`, `sqlState`, `constraint`, `table`, `column`, `detail`.

### MIGRATION.FILE_MISSING

A required migration file is absent: either an on-disk package is missing `migration.json`/`ops.json` (migration-tools loader; re-emit via the package's `migration.ts`), or a `migration.ts` source file was expected at a package directory and not found (scaffold one with `migration new` or `migration plan`). Payload: `file`, `dir` (loader variant) or `dir` (source-file variant).

### MIGRATION.FOREIGN_KEY_VIOLATION

SQLite only: after applying migration plans with `PRAGMA foreign_keys` temporarily off (needed for recreate-table operations), the post-apply `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` reported broken references, and the whole transaction is rolled back. Payload: `violations` (rows from the pragma).

### MIGRATION.HASH_MISMATCH

A migration package on disk is corrupt: the `migrationHash` stored in `migration.json` does not match the hash recomputed from the package contents. Raised whenever migration tooling loads packages (plan, list, apply). Re-emit the package via its `migration.ts` or restore from version control. Payload: `dir`, `storedHash`, `computedHash`.

### MIGRATION.HASH_NOT_IN_GRAPH

A contract hash the user supplied (or that a ref resolved to) is not a node in the on-disk migration graph, raised during plan resolution (`migration plan --from`), `migration ref set`, and `migration new --from` (including `--from` on an empty migrations directory, where there is no migration target it could name). The envelope lists the reachable hashes and suggests a valid one or running `migration plan` to introduce it. Payload: `hash`/`resolvedHash`, `reachableHashes` or `reachableRefs`; none at the `migration new` sites.

### MIGRATION.INVALID_DEFAULT_EXPORT

The `migration.ts` in a package directory does not default-export a valid migration: it must export a `Migration` subclass or a factory function returning a plan-shaped object (`operations` array plus `targetId` and `destination`). Payload: `dir`, `actualExport` (when known).

### MIGRATION.INVALID_DEST_NAME

A copy-destination name in a migration package's copy list is not a single path segment (contains `..` or directory separators). Use a simple file name such as `contract.json`. Payload: `destName`.

### MIGRATION.INVALID_INVARIANT_ID

An `invariantId` on a `dataTransform` is empty or contains whitespace/control characters. Pick an id without spaces, tabs, newlines, or control characters. Payload: `invariantId`.

### MIGRATION.INVALID_JSON

A migration file (`migration.json` or `ops.json`) exists but is not parseable JSON. Re-emit the package via its `migration.ts` or restore from version control. Payload: `filePath`, `parseError`.

### MIGRATION.INVALID_MANIFEST

A `migration.json` manifest parsed as JSON but failed schema validation. Re-emit the package or restore from version control. Payload: `filePath`, `reason`.

### MIGRATION.INVALID_NAME

The migration name given to `migration new`/`migration plan --name` contains no valid characters after sanitization (only a-z and 0-9 are kept). Provide a name with at least one alphanumeric character. Payload: `slug`.

### MIGRATION.INVALID_OPERATION_ENTRY

An operation returned by an authored migration class failed schema validation during emit: each entry of `operations` must carry `id`, `label`, and an `operationClass` of `additive`, `widening`, `destructive`, or `data`. Also raised when deserializing a persisted Mongo migration plan hits a malformed or unknown entry (filter, pipeline stage, DML/DDL/inspection command). Payload: `index`, `reason` (emit validation) or `context`, `kind` (plan deserialization).

### MIGRATION.INVALID_REF_FILE

A ref file under `migrations/<space>/refs/` is not valid JSON or does not match the expected `{ "hash": "<64 hex>", "invariants": [...] }` shape. Payload: `path`, `reason`.

### MIGRATION.INVALID_REF_NAME

A ref name is syntactically invalid: names must be lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens or forward slashes, with no `.` or `..` segments. Raised by `migration ref` commands and any ref-consuming tooling. Payload: `refName`.

### MIGRATION.INVALID_REF_VALUE

The value given for a ref (e.g. to `migration ref set`) is not a valid contract hash: it must be 64 lowercase hex chars or `empty`. Payload: `value`.

### MIGRATION.INVALID_REFS

A legacy `refs.json` file is invalid: it must be a flat object mapping valid ref names to contract hash strings. Payload: `path`, `reason`.

### MIGRATION.INVALID_SPACE_ID

A contract-space id (e.g. via `--space` or in planner input) does not match the required pattern `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`: space ids double as directory names under `migrations/`, so the rule is conservative. Payload: `spaceId`.

### MIGRATION.LEGACY_MARKER_SHAPE

The database's marker table (`prisma_contract.marker` on Postgres, `_prisma_marker` on SQLite) has the pre-per-space shape (no `space` column). The transitional auto-migration has been removed; drop the marker table and re-run `prisma db init` to reinitialise from a clean baseline. Detected during `db init`/`db update`/apply. Payload: `table`, `columns` (runner variant) or `runnerErrorCode` (marker-read variant).

### MIGRATION.LEGEND_HUMAN_ONLY

`migration list --legend` was combined with a machine-readable or silent output flag (`--json`, `--dot`, or `--quiet`); the legend is human-only decoration on stderr. Drop one of the flags. Payload: `conflictingFlag`.

### MIGRATION.MARKER_CAS_FAILURE

While finalizing an apply, the compare-and-swap update of the database's contract marker found the marker had been modified by another process mid-migration: a concurrent migration raced this one. Payload: `space`, `expectedStorageHash`, `destinationStorageHash`.

### MIGRATION.MARKER_MISMATCH

The live database marker's contract hash is not reachable anywhere in the on-disk migration graph: the database and the local migration history have diverged. The fix depends on which side is canonical: `migration plan` (catch the graph up), `migration ref set db <markerHash>` (fix a drifted local ref), or investigate out-of-band migration. Payload: `markerHash`, `reachableHashes`.

### MIGRATION.MARKER_NOT_IN_HISTORY

A warning diagnostic (not a hard failure) in `migration status`: the database's marker hash does not match any migration in the history, meaning the database was updated outside the migration system. Hints suggest `db sign` (overwrite marker) or `db update` (push the contract).

### MIGRATION.MARKER_ORIGIN_MISMATCH

Runner-level failure during apply: the plan asserts an origin contract, but the database marker is missing, or its storage hash (or profile hash) differs from the plan's origin: the database is not at the state the plan was computed from. Re-plan from the database's actual state; `db init` intercepts this code to render an init-specific "already initialised at a different contract" message. Payload: `expectedOriginStorageHash` plus `markerStorageHash`/`markerProfileHash` depending on the branch.

### MIGRATION.MISSING_INVARIANTS

A diagnostic in `migration status`: the active ref requires data invariants that the database marker does not record as provided. If no path through the graph can supply them, status escalates to `MIGRATION.NO_INVARIANT_PATH`. Payload: `ref` (when a ref is active), `invariants` (the missing ids).

### MIGRATION.NO_CHANGES

`migration new` found the from and to contract hashes identical: there is nothing to migrate. Change the contract and re-run `prisma contract emit` first, or pass `--from <hash>` explicitly to author a data-only migration on the current contract hash. Payload: none.

### MIGRATION.NO_INVARIANT_PATH

The target (or named ref) requires data invariants, and no path through the migration graph from the current state covers all of them. Add a migration on the path that runs a `dataTransform` with each missing `invariantId`, or retarget the ref. Payload: `required`, `missing`, `structuralPath` (edges: `dirName`, `migrationHash`, `from`, `to`, `invariants`), `refName` (when applicable). Also raised per space by `db migrate` in show/plan mode when a space's path requires invariants not available on disk; that site's meta is `spaceId`, `missing`.

### MIGRATION.NO_MIGRATIONS

`migration show` was given a non-path reference but the app space has no migration packages at all, so there is nothing to resolve against. Create a migration with `prisma migration plan` first. Payload: none.

### MIGRATION.OPERATION_OPTION_REMOVED

A `migration.ts` passes an operation an option in the form an earlier version wrote, which this version no longer reads. `node migration.ts` strips types without checking them, so such a file runs; the operation refuses the option rather than leave out what it carries. Raised for a column default written as SQL text in `defaultSql`: by PostgreSQL `setDefault`, whose `column` is now `col(name, type, { default, codecRef })`, and by SQLite `addColumn` and `recreateTable`, whose columns now carry `default` and `codecRef`. The fix names the new form and the upgrade entry that shows it; if the migration is not applied, deleting its package and running `migration plan` again also works. Payload: `operation`, `option`, `upgradeEntry`.

### MIGRATION.OPERATION_UNSUPPORTED

A Mongo migration check uses a filter feature the check evaluator does not support: an unsupported filter operator, or an aggregation-expression filter. Payload: `operator`.

### MIGRATION.PACKAGE_NOT_FOUND

`migration show` or `migration check` resolved its target (a directory path, or a migration reference) but no loaded on-disk migration package matches it, either no package lives at the given path, or the resolved migration's package failed to load. `migration check` raises it at exit `2`: it could not run the check at all, which is different from running it and finding something. Pass a directory name, hash prefix, or path to an on-disk migration package, or inspect the migrations directory for corruption. Payload: none.

### MIGRATION.PATH_UNREACHABLE

An apply command (`db migrate`/`db update`) cannot find a path through the on-disk migration graph from the database's current marker to the requested target: the connecting edge was never planned. The fix walks you through `migration plan` (with the right `--from`/`--to`) then `db migrate`. Payload: carries the underlying failure's meta (`fromHash`, `targetHash`, `deadEnds`, `kind`).

### MIGRATION.PLANNING_FAILED

Migration planning (typically during `db init`/`db update`) failed because of conflicts, e.g. the live database already contains objects that clash with the plan. The envelope aggregates each conflict's summary and suggested fix. Payload: `conflicts`. `db init` applies only additive operations, so when a conflict is an operation its policy refused (the conflict carries `refusedOperationClass`), such as adding a validator to a Mongo collection that already holds documents, the error's next action depends on the refused classes. When `db update` allows all of them (`widening` and `destructive`), the next action is `db update`, which applies them, asking you to confirm destructive ones. When one is `data`, which `db update` does not apply, the next action is `migration plan`, to plan a migration that `db migrate` then applies.

### MIGRATION.PLAN_NOT_ARRAY

An authored migration's `operations` getter returned something other than an array. Fix the migration class so `operations` returns an array of operations. Payload: `dir`, `actualValue` (when known).

### MIGRATION.PLAN_ORIGIN_UNKNOWN

`migration plan` or `migration new` was run without `--from` and without a `db` ref while migrations already exist on disk. Planning would silently fall back to an empty-database origin and produce a migration that recreates everything the existing history already creates, so the command refuses. Set the `db` ref (`migration ref set db <contract>` or `db update`), pass `--from <contract>`, or (for `migration plan`) pass `--from @empty` to deliberately plan from an empty database. Payload: `reachableRefs`.

### MIGRATION.POLICY_VIOLATION

A planned operation's class (e.g. `destructive`) is not allowed by the execution-time operation policy in force for the command. Runner-level failure during apply. Payload: `operationId`, `operationClass`, `allowedClasses`.

### MIGRATION.POSTCHECK_FAILED

After executing a migration operation, one of its postcheck steps (a query expected to return true) did not hold, so the apply is rolled back. Payload: `operationId`, `phase`, `stepDescription`.

### MIGRATION.POSTGRES_CONTROL_STACK_MISSING

A `PostgresMigration` operation (e.g. `createTable`, `dataTransform`) was invoked on an instance constructed without a control stack: normal CLI-driven runs always assemble one from `prisma.config.ts`, so this indicates a test fixture or ad-hoc consumer used the no-arg constructor (valid only for introspection). Payload: `operation`.

### MIGRATION.PRECHECK_FAILED

Before executing a migration operation, one of its precheck steps (a query expected to return true) did not hold: the database is not in the state the operation requires, so the apply stops and rolls back. Payload: `operationId`, `phase`, `stepDescription`.

### MIGRATION.PROVIDED_INVARIANTS_MISMATCH

The `providedInvariants` stored in `migration.json` disagrees with the canonical value derived from `ops.json`: the manifest was likely hand-edited without re-emitting (a same-ids-different-order case is called out explicitly). Re-emit the package. Payload: `filePath`, `stored`, `derived`, `difference` (`{missing, extra}`).

### MIGRATION.REF_AMBIGUOUS

A contract or migration reference prefix matches more than one candidate (raised by the shared ref-resolution mapper used across CLI commands, and by `migration new --from` when the prefix matches several migration target hashes). Provide a longer prefix or the full hash. Payload: `input`, `candidates`, and at the shared-mapper site `grammar`.

### MIGRATION.REF_INVALID_FORMAT

A contract or migration reference is syntactically invalid: it is not a hash, ref name, or migration directory name in any accepted form (raised by the shared ref-resolution mapper). Payload: `input`.

### MIGRATION.REF_NOT_FOUND

A contract or migration reference does not resolve: no matching hash, ref name, or migration directory name exists in the migration graph or refs index (raised by the shared ref-resolution mapper used across CLI commands). Payload: `input`, `grammar`.

### MIGRATION.REF_NOT_RESOLVABLE

A ref name resolves to nothing: no pointer file with that name exists, and the fallback hash is not a node in the migration graph either, so there is no contract to materialize. Create the ref with `migration ref set`, advance it via `db update --advance-ref`, or pass a graph-node hash. Payload: `refName`, `identifier`.

### MIGRATION.REF_SET_BUNDLE_NOT_FOUND

`migration ref set` resolved the given hash to a graph node, but no on-disk migration bundle has that hash as its destination, so the ref would point at a node with no backing package. Re-emit the migration that produces this hash. Payload: `hash`.

### MIGRATION.REF_SET_EMPTY_SENTINEL

`migration ref set` was asked to point a ref at the empty-database sentinel hash, which is a planner internal and not a valid ref target. Use a real contract hash from the migration graph. Payload: `hash`.

### MIGRATION.REF_WRONG_GRAMMAR

A reference parsed, but as the wrong kind for the argument position, e.g. a migration-only reference where a contract reference is required (raised by the shared ref-resolution mapper). The message and fix come from the resolver's own diagnosis. Payload: `input`, `expectedGrammar`.

### MIGRATION.RUNNER_FAILED

Generic wrapper for a migration runner failure during execution that has no more specific code; the summary/why carry the underlying detail (also used to surface the legacy-marker-shape condition from marker reads, with `meta.runnerErrorCode`). `db migrate` and `db init` map unrecognized apply failures through it, passing the failure's own meta through unchanged. Inspect the reported summary/why detail and address the underlying failure before re-running the command. Payload: the wrapped failure's meta, when it has any; `runnerErrorCode` at the legacy-marker-shape site.

### MIGRATION.SAME_SOURCE_AND_TARGET

A migration's `from` and `to` hashes are identical and it declares no data-transform operations, a pure no-op self-edge, which is only allowed when the migration runs at least one `dataTransform`. Change the contract, add a dataTransform, or delete the migration. Payload: `dirName`, `hash`.

### MIGRATION.SCHEMA_VERIFY_FAILED

After applying migrations, the runner introspected the database and the resulting schema does not satisfy the destination contract; the apply is rolled back. Runner-level failure during `db init`/`db update`/`db migrate`. Payload: `issues` (schema diff issues).

### MIGRATION.SNAPSHOT_MISSING

A `--from` reference cannot produce a contract: either a ref name has no pointer file and the fallback hash is not a graph node (`viaRef: true`), or an explicit `--from <hash>` was given on an empty migration graph and names no ref (`viaRef: false`). Payload: `identifier`, `viaRef`. Also raised by `db sign` when a contract reference resolves to a hash but no migration produces that hash and the emitted contract does not match; that site has no meta.

### MIGRATION.SPACE_NOT_FOUND

`migration list --space <id>` (and similar space-scoped commands) named a contract space with no directory under `migrations/`. Distinct from an existing-but-empty space, which renders an empty state and exits 0. The envelope lists the space directories that do exist. Payload: `spaceId`, `availableSpaces`.

### MIGRATION.SQLITE_CONTROL_STACK_MISSING

SQLite twin of `MIGRATION.POSTGRES_CONTROL_STACK_MISSING`: a `SqliteMigration` operation needing the control adapter was invoked on an instance constructed without a control stack (only introspection is valid in that form). Payload: `operation`.

### MIGRATION.TABLE_NAME_CASE_CHANGED

The planner would drop table `X` and create table `Y` in the same namespace, where `X` is `Y` with its first letter lowered; the columns are not compared. That is the shape of a schema upgraded across the release in which a model with no `@@map` stopped lowering the first letter of its table name (`model UserProfile` now names `"UserProfile"`, previously `"userProfile"`); planning it would recreate the table empty. Reported as a conflict inside `MIGRATION.PLANNING_FAILED`. Add `@@map("X")` to the model (or run the `add-model-map` codemod) to keep the existing table, or rename it by hand with `ALTER TABLE "X" RENAME TO "Y"`, after which the plan is empty. Payload: `droppedTable`, `createdTable`.

### MIGRATION.TARGET_MISMATCH

A migration script declares one `targetId` but the loaded `prisma.config.ts` declares another; the script can only run against a config targeting the same database. Switch configs or pass `--config <path>`. Payload: `migrationTargetId`, `configTargetId`.

### MIGRATION.TARGET_NOT_APP_SPACE

A filesystem-path target given to a migration command does not resolve to an app-space migration directory: it points outside the app space's migrations directory, or at that directory's root itself. Pass an app-space migration directory or use a hash prefix. Payload: none.

### MIGRATION.TARGET_UNSUPPORTED

The configured target does not provide migration support (no planner/runner via `target.migrations`), so migration commands like `db init` cannot run against it. Select a target that provides migrations.

### MIGRATION.UNFILLED_PLACEHOLDER

A scaffolded migration still contains a `placeholder(...)` call that the author never replaced with a real query; it throws when the migration is emitted or run. The `slot` names the exact location to edit (e.g. `"backfill-product-status:check.source"`). Payload: `slot`.

### MIGRATION.UNKNOWN_INVARIANT

A ref declares required invariants that no migration anywhere in the graph provides, either the ref has a typo or the providing migration has not been authored yet. Payload: `unknown`, `declared`, `refName` (when applicable).

### MIGRATION.UNKNOWN_REF

A ref name was used (read, resolved, or deleted via `migration ref` commands) but no ref file with that name exists. Create it with `prisma migration ref set <name> <hash>`, or run `migration ref list` to see what exists. Payload: `refName`, `filePath` or `availableRefs` depending on the site.

## PLAN

### PLAN.HASH_MISMATCH

At execute time, the plan's `meta.storageHash` does not match the runtime contract's storage hash: the plan was built against a different version of the contract than the one the runtime holds. Rebuild the plan against the current contract. Payload: `planStorageHash`, `runtimeStorageHash`.

### PLAN.TARGET_MISMATCH

At execute time, the plan's `meta.target` does not match the runtime contract's target, e.g. a plan built for postgres submitted to a sqlite runtime. Payload: `planTarget`, `runtimeTarget`.

## BUDGET

### BUDGET.ROWS_EXCEEDED

The `budgets` middleware blocks (or warns about) a query expected or observed to return more rows than the configured `maxRows` budget. Thrown before execution for an unbounded SELECT (no LIMIT, no aggregate-without-GROUP-BY) or when the AST-based row estimate exceeds the budget, and during row streaming when the observed row count crosses `maxRows`; raw-SQL guardrails also emit it for raw SELECT text without a LIMIT clause. Payload: `source` (`'ast'` or `'observed'`), `estimatedRows`, `observedRows`, `maxRows`.

### BUDGET.TIME_EXCEEDED

The `budgets` middleware reports after execution that a query's latency exceeded the configured `maxLatencyMs` budget. Default severity is warn (logged); it throws when the latency severity is configured as `error` or the runtime runs in strict mode. Payload: `latencyMs`, `maxLatencyMs`.

## LINT

### LINT.DELETE_WITHOUT_WHERE

The `lints` middleware found a DELETE plan with no WHERE clause and blocks execution to prevent an accidental full-table deletion. Default severity is error (throws); configurable to warn. Payload: `table`.

### LINT.NO_LIMIT

The `lints` middleware (or raw-SQL guardrails) found a SELECT with no LIMIT, which may return an unboundedly large result set. Default severity is warn (logged, execution proceeds); raw-SQL plans are checked heuristically against the SQL text. Payload: `table` (AST path) or `sql` snippet (raw path).

### LINT.READ_ONLY_MUTATION

Raw-SQL guardrails found a mutating statement (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DDL) in a plan whose meta annotations declare a read-only intent (`read`, `report`, or `readonly`). Default severity is error (throws). Payload: `sql`, `intent`.

### LINT.SELECT_STAR

The `lints` middleware found a query that selects all columns, via the builder's selectAll intent on AST plans, or a literal `SELECT *` in raw SQL. Default severity is warn on the AST path, error on the raw path. Payload: `table` (AST path) or `sql` snippet (raw path).

### LINT.UPDATE_WITHOUT_WHERE

The `lints` middleware found an UPDATE plan with no WHERE clause and blocks execution to prevent an accidental full-table update. Default severity is error (throws); configurable to warn. Payload: `table`.

## PARADEDB

### PARADEDB.ARGUMENT_INVALID

A ParadeDB search-function helper received an invalid argument: a malformed query object, an out-of-range numeric option, or an option combination the function does not accept. Raised while authoring/lowering the search expression. Payload: `helper`, `argument`, `received`.

## POSTGIS

### POSTGIS.GEOMETRY_INVALID

A PostGIS geometry constructor (`point`, `polygon`, `bboxPolygon`, …) received invalid input: non-finite coordinates, a ring that is not closed, too few points, or a malformed bounding box. Raised at construction time, before the value reaches the database. Payload: `constructor`, `received`, `reason`.

## SUPABASE

### SUPABASE.CONFIG_INVALID

The Supabase extension's runtime configuration is invalid: missing or contradictory connection/auth settings (formerly the `SupabaseConfigError` class, removed at 0.17). Payload: `reason`.

### SUPABASE.JWT_INVALID

A JWT handed to the Supabase runtime failed validation: malformed token, missing claims, or signature/JWKS mismatch (formerly the `InvalidJwtError` class, removed at 0.17). Payload: `reason`.

## TESTKIT

Raised by the codec conformance testkits (`@internal/postgres-codec-testkit`, `@internal/sqlite-codec-testkit`) while running an extension author's conformance cases against a live database.

### TESTKIT.CODEC_DESCRIPTOR_MISSING

A conformance case names a codec id the target's built-in descriptor registry does not know, and the case supplies no descriptor of its own. The harness projects and decodes through the codec descriptor under test, so an extension codec must be supplied on the case. Payload: `codecId`.

### TESTKIT.CONFORMANCE_CASE_INVALID

A `many` conformance case carries a value that is neither an array nor null: the harness maps element-wise over array cases and has nothing to map over. Give the case an array of element values, or null.

### TESTKIT.PROJECTION_MALFORMED

The executed JSON projection came back in a shape the codec descriptor does not declare: the projected document is missing its value key, or an array projection produced something other than a JSON array or null. This points at the projection SQL the descriptor under test renders. Payload: `codecId` (when the case is known).
