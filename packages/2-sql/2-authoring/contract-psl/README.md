# @internal/sql-contract-psl

PSL-first SQL contract interpretation for Prisma 8.

## Overview

`@internal/sql-contract-psl` provides two entrypoints:

- **Pure interpreter** (`@internal/sql-contract-psl`): parsed PSL document -> SQL `Contract`
- **Provider helper** (`@internal/sql-contract-psl/provider`): read file -> parse -> interpret -> `ContractConfig`

This keeps core/CLI source-agnostic while giving PSL-first SQL users a one-line config helper.

## Responsibilities

- Interpret a PSL `SymbolTable` into SQL `Contract`
- Interpret generic PSL attributes into SQL contract semantics (`@id`, `@unique`, `@default`, `@relation`, `@map`, `@@map`, `@@control`)
- Interpret SQL timestamp semantics: `DateTime @default(now())` as a storage default, and `temporal.createdAt()` / `temporal.updatedAt()` as client-side execution mutation defaults
- Lower shared constructor expressions in both `types {}` blocks and inline field positions (for example `ShortName = sql.String(length: 35)` and `embedding pgvector.Vector(length: 1536)?`)
- Lower supported default functions through composed registry inputs
- Resolve Postgres native storage types from bare names and constructor calls in type position (`Char`, `VarChar`, `Numeric`, `Uuid`, `Inet`, `SmallInt`, `Real`, `Timestamp`, `Timestamptz`, `Date`, `Time`, `Timetz`, `Json`, `Jsonb`, `BigIntNumber`, `UnboundedInt`)
- Map PSL relation action tokens to SQL contract referential actions and emit diagnostics for unsupported values
- Emit deterministic relation metadata in `models.<Model>.relations`
- Enforce extension composition for namespaced constructor expressions and emit strict diagnostics for unsupported namespaced attributes
- Validate generator applicability by declared `codecId` support on composed generator descriptors
- Consume target-bound scalar descriptors, shared authoring contributions, and mutation-default registries assembled by composition layers
- Compose provider flow for SQL PSL-first config (`read -> parse -> interpret`) without local registry assembly
- Preserve parser diagnostics and add interpreter diagnostics with stable codes
- Return `notOk` with structured diagnostics for unsupported constructs
- Keep interpretation deterministic for equivalent AST inputs

Determinism note:
- Relation metadata emission is intentionally **sorted by storage table name, then model name, then relation field name** (not PSL declaration order) so `contract.json` snapshots and hashes are stable across environments.

## Non-responsibilities

- Canonical artifact emission (`contract.json`, `contract.d.ts`) and hashing
- CLI or ControlClient orchestration

The **pure interpreter entrypoint** specifically excludes:
- File I/O (`schema.prisma` reading)
- PSL parsing (`parse` + `buildSymbolTable`)
- Artifact emission (`contract.json`, `contract.d.ts`) and hashing
- CLI or ControlClient orchestration

Current scope is SQL target-specific: callers pass scalar descriptors and target context assembled for the active SQL target.

Unsupported PSL constructs in v1 (strict errors):

- **Scalar lists need the target's `scalarList` capability.** `String[]`, `Int[]` and enum lists such as `Role[]` lower to native array columns when the adapter reports `scalarList` (Postgres). On a target that does not (SQLite) they are `PSL_SCALAR_LIST_UNSUPPORTED_TARGET`.
- **Value-object fields need the stack's value-object storage type.** A field typed by a composite type is stored in one column of the storage type the adapter declares (`Jsonb` on Postgres, `Json` on SQLite), a list of value objects included. On a stack that declares none, each such field is `PSL_UNSUPPORTED_FIELD_TYPE`.
- **Composite types take no attributes.** An attribute on a member, such as `street String @default("x")`, is `PSL_UNSUPPORTED_FIELD_ATTRIBUTE`, and a block attribute on the type, such as `@@map`, is `PSL_UNSUPPORTED_COMPOSITE_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE`. A default for a value object is written on the model field, as a whole value.
- **Relation navigation lists are supported** when they can be matched to an FK-side relation:
  - Example: `User.posts Post[]` + `Post.user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])`
  - Matching may use `@relation("Name")` or `@relation(name: "Name")` when multiple candidates exist
  - Navigation list fields accept only `@relation` (name-only form); other field attributes are strict errors
- **Implicit Prisma ORM many-to-many remains unsupported** (list navigation on both sides without explicit join model)
  - Represent many-to-many with an explicit join model (two foreign keys)

Supported `@default(...)` surface in v1 when composed contributors provide handlers:

- Storage defaults: `autoincrement()`, `now()`, literals, and raw SQL as a `sql` tagged literal
- Every written default has a data type of its own, decided by what is written rather than by the column: a quoted string, `true`/`false`, a number whose type comes from its own size and precision, and a JSON document written `` @default(json`{ "plan": "free" }`) ``. The column's type takes the value when it is that type or declares a cast from it, so `Int @default(100000000000000099)` is refused before anything is decoded: `PSL_VALUE_TYPE_INCOMPATIBLE`, naming the cast the column's type would need and the types it does cast from. A value the type's own reader or a cast refuses, such as the text of a `json` literal that is not a JSON document, is `PSL_INVALID_LITERAL`. A value the column's codec refuses — a `pgvector.Vector(3)` given two elements — is `PSL_INVALID_DEFAULT_LITERAL`, and a single value on a list column is `PSL_DEFAULT_LIST_EXPECTED`. A column whose data type has no written form of its own and no cast into it takes only a `` sql`...` `` default. See [ADR 254](../../../../docs/architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20254%20-%20Data%20types%20and%20casts.md).
- Raw SQL defaults as a tagged literal: a tag followed by a string literal, as in `` @default(sql`(now() + interval '7 days')`) `` or, for a body with backticks, `@default(sql"(now() + '00:03:00'::interval)")`. The string may use any quote style, and whitespace, newlines, or comments may sit between the tag and the string. A backtick string may span lines and resolves only `` \` `` and `\\`, so `${` is ordinary text and needs no escape; `"` and `'` strings resolve the usual escapes. A backtick string is only valid after a tag; anywhere else it is `PSL_BACKTICK_STRING_REQUIRES_TAG`. The body written between the quotes is canonicalized (line endings, a blank first and last line, common indentation) into the text, which is used verbatim as the default expression. A text that is exactly `now()` or `autoincrement()` (`` sql`now()` ``) is refused: write the named form, `@default(now())`. Any other text, including `NOW()` and `gen_random_uuid()`, is used as written. `sql` is the tag of the data type `sql/expression`, which the SQL family defines and registers. There are no target-prefixed tags: `pg.sql` and `sqlite.sql` are unknown. An unregistered tag is `PSL_UNKNOWN_LITERAL_TAG`, reported at the literal.
- A list of value objects is stored in one column, whose value is the list. Its default is a list literal of the column type's values or one value of that type, and both give the same default: `homes Address[] @default([])` and `` @default(json`[]`) ``, or `` @default([json`{"street": "x"}`]) `` and `` @default(json`[{"street": "x"}]`) ``. A list literal on a single value object is `PSL_VALUE_TYPE_INCOMPATIBLE`.
- A literal default on a value-object field must match its composite type: a JSON object for a single value object and a JSON array of them for a list (or JSON `null` when the field is optional), with no key that is not a member, a value for every member that is not optional, and nested value objects checked the same way. The default holds each member in the stored form its codec writes, so each scalar member's codec must read the member's value: a `Decimal` or `BigInt` member takes a decimal string such as `"1.5"`, and a `Json` member takes any JSON value. A shape mismatch is `PSL_VALUE_TYPE_INCOMPATIBLE` and a value the member's codec refuses is `PSL_INVALID_DEFAULT_LITERAL`, each naming the path, as in `Field "User.home.street"`. A member typed by an enum takes only the enum's values, in the form its codec stores them; another value is `PSL_INVALID_DEFAULT_LITERAL`, `Expected one of:` the values.
- A list column takes storage defaults: a list literal, `now()`, or `` sql`...` `` (`` tags String[] @default(sql`'{}'::text[]`) ``). Whether the expression returns a value of the column's type is the author's responsibility; the database reports a mismatch. `autoincrement()` on a list column is `PSL_LIST_AUTOINCREMENT_UNSUPPORTED`, and an execution default such as `uuid()` is `PSL_LIST_EXECUTION_DEFAULT_UNSUPPORTED`. See [ADR 129](../../../../docs/architecture%20docs/adrs/ADR%20129%20-%20Template-Tagged%20Literals%20for%20Extensions.md).
- Execution defaults: `uuid()`, `uuid(4)`, `uuid(7)`, `cuid(2)`, `ulid()`, `nanoid()`, `nanoid(<2-255>)`
- Explicitly unsupported in v1: `cuid()` (diagnostic suggests `cuid(2)`)
- `@default(dbgenerated("..."))` is not a default function. A call by that name is `PSL_UNKNOWN_DEFAULT_FUNCTION` with a message that names the `sql` tagged literal that replaces it and the supported functions.

Supported timestamp authoring surface:

- `createdAt DateTime @default(now())` lowers to the target storage default and does not create an execution mutation default.
- `createdAt temporal.createdAt()` generates a client-side timestamp on create, without a database default.
- `updatedAt temporal.updatedAt()` uses the same execution generator on create and on non-empty update mutations. Matching representations share one generated value per operation; updates leave `createdAt` unchanged. These semantics are application-side, not database triggers.
- The Prisma-flavored `@updatedAt` attribute is not supported; references produce `PSL_UNSUPPORTED_FIELD_ATTRIBUTE` with a migration hint pointing at `temporal.updatedAt()`. The hint is suppressed when the field already declares any `temporal.*` preset.
- `@createdAt` is not supported as a PSL alias.

Field-preset calls in type position:

- A field may use a registered field-preset call as its type (`createdAt temporal.createdAt()`). A preset is a complete field declaration — it carries its own codec, native type, and any default semantics.
- Preset-call fields reject the modifiers the preset already decides: `?` optional (`PSL_PRESET_NOT_OPTIONAL`), `@default(...)` (`PSL_PRESET_AND_DEFAULT_CONFLICT`), `@id` unless the preset contributes id semantics (`PSL_PRESET_AND_ID_CONFLICT`), and list use (`PSL_PRESET_NOT_LIST`).

Integer representation authoring surface:

- `BigInt` keeps the lossless `bigint` codec (`pg/int8@1` / `sqlite/bigint@1`): values read and write as JS `bigint`, and 64-bit integers travel through database-produced JSON as decimal text.
- Bare `BigIntNumber` (PostgreSQL and SQLite) opts an `int8`/INTEGER column into JS `number` reads and writes. Both directions throw structured errors outside ±(2^53 − 1) or on non-integral values: `RUNTIME.ENCODE_FAILED` on write, `RUNTIME.DECODE_FAILED` on read.
- Bare `UnboundedInt` (PostgreSQL only) reads and writes an unconstrained `numeric` as a JS `bigint`, exact at any magnitude; decode rejects non-integral values. SQLite declares no equivalent because it has no lossless unbounded integer storage.
- These are ordinary target-scoped types rather than field presets, so ordinary scalar modifiers apply subject to the target's capabilities.
- Selection guidance, canonical JSON forms, the safe-range soundness argument, and aggregate behavior: [Integer representation types](../../../../docs/reference/integer-representation-types.md).

`@@index` parameter surface:

```prisma
@@index([email], where: "(archived_at IS NULL)", name: "users_email_active")
@@index(expression: "eql_v3.eq_term(email)", name: "users_email_eq")
@@index(expression: "lower(email)", unique: true, name: "users_email_lower_key")
@@index([email], type: "hash", name: "users_email_hash")
```

- Exactly one of a fields list or `expression:` (the whole CREATE INDEX element list as one opaque string); violating this raises `PSL_INDEX_FIELDS_XOR_EXPRESSION`.
- `expression:` requires `name:` or `map:` (`PSL_INDEX_EXPRESSION_REQUIRES_NAME` — no default name can be derived from an expression); at most one of `name:`/`map:` (`PSL_INDEX_NAME_XOR_MAP`).
- `name:` declares a wire-named index — the physical name is `<name>_<8-hex content hash>` and renames plan as `ALTER INDEX … RENAME`. `map:` adopts an exact physical name verbatim, intended for objects captured by `contract infer`.
- `where:` is a partial-index predicate (WHERE body, without the keyword); `unique:` a boolean; `type:` plus `options:` select a target-registered index access method (e.g. `type: "hash"`). Unlike the TS builder (whose pack-typed arm requires the `options` key at compile time), PSL accepts `type:` without `options:` — absent options validate as `{}` and lower to the same IR.
- `map:` combined with a SQL body (`expression:`/`where:`) emits the `PN_EXACT_NAME_BODY_COMPARISON` warning: drift detection byte-compares the authored text against Postgres's reprinted form, which is only reliable for infer-captured text — prefer `name:` for hand-authored bodies.

Model-level control policy:

- `@@control(<policy>)` lowers to the storage table's `control` field. The argument is one positional lowercase literal: `managed`, `tolerated`, `external`, or `observed`. Omit `@@control` to leave per-table control unset (the framework default applies at runtime).

Contract-level default (specifier options bag):

- `defaultControlPolicy` on `prismaContract(...)` sets `Contract.defaultControlPolicy` at load time when the interpreted contract does not already define one (source wins when both are present).

## Public API

- `@internal/sql-contract-psl`
  - `interpretPslDocumentToSqlContract({ symbolTable, sourceFile, sourceId, target, scalarColumnDescriptors, composedExtensionContracts, seedDiagnostics?, authoringContributions?, controlMutationDefaults?, composedExtensions? })` — build `symbolTable`/`sourceFile` via `parse(schema)` + `buildSymbolTable(...)` from `@internal/psl-parser`.
- `@internal/sql-contract-psl/provider`
  - `prismaContract(schemaPath, { output?, target, createNamespace, composedExtensionPackRefs?, defaultControlPolicy?, enumInferenceCodecs? })` — scalar column descriptors are derived from the composed stack's authoring type namespace at load time.
  - Provider input is fully preassembled by composition layers (for example `@internal/family-sql/control` helpers).
- `@internal/sql-contract-psl/map-names`
  - `pslModelMapName(modelName, tableName)` and `pslFieldMapName(fieldName, columnName)` — the `@@map` or `@map` name a model or field must carry to read back with that table or column name, or `undefined` when the name this source derives already matches. Code that writes PSL uses them to decide when to write the attribute.
